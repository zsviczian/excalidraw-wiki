# Disappearing text or footnote after Drawing section

If you or a plugin add some text after the Drawing section, it will disappear when the drawing is saved again, similarly to [this](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/2012) issue. In this case you can consider enabling the [[Excalidraw Settings Overview#Zotero and Footnotes compatibility|Zotero and Footnotes compatibility]] option so that the text under said section is preserved after each save.
