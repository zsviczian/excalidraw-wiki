# Pen Issues
## Crosshair not visible with Wacom Stylus

Based on comment on YouTube and [GitHub](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/1681#issuecomment-2600937585) by [@n30s4m](http://www.youtube.com/@n30s4m):

> I use a Wacom Intuos CTL-4100 and I was unable to see the cursor when I tried to operate the pen. To solve it, I went into the pen settings in the pen program and changed some settings.
> 
> 1. I added the Obsidian program.
> 2. In options, pen button mode, I chose click and tap.
> 3. I enabled pressure compatibility.
>  
> Now, i see the pointer.
