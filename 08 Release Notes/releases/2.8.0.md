![PDF Export: Excalidraw Obsidian 2.8.0 Feature Walkthrough](https://youtu.be/tWi5xTUTz7E)

## New
- Updated "Export Image" dialog
  - üöÄ PDF Export option, including tiling of images over multiple pages.  Only available on desktop. Big thank you to @mnaoumov for the help with figuring out how to print to PDF with Electron out of the box.
  - SVG to clipboard
  - More granular setting for padding and scale
  - Slideshow script can now print slides to PDF (update script from script store)
- Set local graph to show the links in the embeddable when it is activated/deactivated [#2200](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/2200)

## Fixed
- Fixed several LaTeX issues. üôè @Sintuz [#1631](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/1631), [#2195](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/2195), [#1842](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/1842)
- Fixed support for *.jfif and *.avif images [#2212](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/2212)
- PDF++ selection is not correctly showing after embedded into a drawing (for some specific files) [#2213](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/2213)
- iOS 18 can't upload image and library [#2182](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/2182)
- Image block references are broken in hover previews [#2218](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/2218)
  - Note there is a known issue in Obsidian 1.8.2 affecting preview windows. I understand this will be fixed in 1.8.3. For now, if hover previews are important to you, you can downgrade to Obsidian 1.8.1 [#2228](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/2225) 
- Mobile elements panel and context menu are not scrollable  [#2216](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/2216)
- "Local Font" menu disappears when opening a drawing in an Obsidian popout-window [#2205](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/2205)

## Updates from Excalidraw.com
- Pressing delete on a frame will only delete the children [#9011](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/9011)
- New crowfoot arrowheads and a new arrowhead picker [#8942](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/8942)
- Fixed some of the arrow binding issues [#9010](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/9010), [#2209](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/2209)
- New context menu action: "Wrap selection in frame" [#9005](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/9005)
- Elbow arrow segment fixing and positioning [#8952](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/8952)
- When drag creating a new frame, do not add a partial group to it. When wrapping a selected partial group in a frame however, do add it to the wrapping frame. But such that it should be separated from the previous containing group. [#9014](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/9014)

## New in ExcalidrawAutomate
- New hook: `onImageFileNameHook`. When set, this callback is triggered when a image is being saved in Excalidraw.
- PDF export functions, paving the way for slideshow to export slides to PDF
```ts
    /**
     * Returns the dimensions of a standard page size in pixels.
     *
     * @param {PageSize} pageSize - The standard page size. Possible values are "A0", "A1", "A2", "A3", "A4", "A5", "Letter", "Legal", "Tabloid".
     * @param {PageOrientation} orientation - The orientation of the page. Possible values are "portrait" and "landscape".
     * @returns {PageDimensions} - An object containing the width and height of the page in pixels.
     *
     * @typedef {Object} PageDimensions
     * @property {number} width - The width of the page in pixels.
     * @property {number} height - The height of the page in pixels.
     *
     * @example
     * const dimensions = getPageDimensions("A4", "portrait");
     * console.log(dimensions); // { width: 794.56, height: 1122.56 }

    /**
     * Creates a PDF from the provided SVG elements with specified scaling and page properties.
     *
     * @param {Object} params - The parameters for creating the PDF.
     * @param {SVGSVGElement[]} params.SVG - An array of SVG elements to be included in the PDF.
     * @param {PDFExportScale} [params.scale={ fitToPage: 1, zoom: 1 }] - The scaling options for the SVG elements.
     * @param {PDFPageProperties} [params.pageProps] - The properties for the PDF pages.
     * @returns {Promise<ArrayBuffer>} - A promise that resolves to an ArrayBuffer containing the PDF data.
     *
     * @example
     * const pdfData = await createToPDF({
     *   SVG: [svgElement1, svgElement2],
     *   scale: { fitToPage: 1 },
     *   pageProps: {
     *     dimensions: { width: 794.56, height: 1122.56 },
     *     backgroundColor: "#ffffff",
     *     margin: { left: 20, right: 20, top: 20, bottom: 20 },
     *     alignment: "center",

/**
 * If set, this callback is triggered when a image is being saved in Excalidraw.
 * You can use this callback to customize the naming and path of pasted images to avoid
 * default names like "Pasted image 123147170.png" being saved in the attachments folder,
 * and instead use more meaningful names based on the Excalidraw file or other criteria,
 * plus save the image in a different folder.
 * 
 * If the function returns null or undefined, the normal Excalidraw operation will continue
 * with the excalidraw generated name and default path.
 * If a filepath is returned, that will be used. Include the full Vault filepath and filename
 * with the file extension.
 * The currentImageName is the name of the image generated by excalidraw or provided during paste.
 * 
 * @param data - An object containing the following properties:
 *   @property {string} [currentImageName] - Default name for the image.
 *   @property {string} drawingFilePath - The file path of the Excalidraw file where the image is being used.
 * 
 * @returns {string} - The new filepath for the image including full vault path and extension.
 * 
 * Example usage:
 * onImageFilePathHook: (data) => {
 *   const { currentImageName, drawingFilePath } = data;
 *   // Generate a new filepath based on the drawing file name and other criteria
 *   const ext = currentImageName.split('.').pop();
 *   return `${drawingFileName} - ${currentImageName || 'image'}.${ext}`;
 * }
