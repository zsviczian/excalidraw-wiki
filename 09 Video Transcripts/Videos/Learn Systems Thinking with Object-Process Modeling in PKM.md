![Learn Systems Thinking with Object-Process Modeling in PKM](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U)

# Summary
In this video, Zsolt introduces Object-Process Methodology (OPM) as a powerful tool for systems thinking and personal knowledge management (PKM). He explains the importance of understanding the relationships between objects and processes within a system, highlighting how these concepts apply to real-world scenarios. Through practical examples, Zsolt aims to demystify OPM and demonstrate how it can enhance our ability to navigate and manage complex information systems.

# Key Takeaways
- Object-Process Methodology (OPM) helps visualize the interconnectedness of objects (nouns) and processes (verbs) within systems.
- Understanding the structure and behavior of a system is crucial for effective personal knowledge management.
- Different modeling languages exist and can be learned to gain diverse insights; mastering even one can significantly improve comprehension of complex systems.

# Content
Welcome back to Visual PKM, I'm Zsolt. [* ](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=0) Today we continue our exploration of diagrams by exploring the Object-Process methodology. [* ](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=4) But why should you care? In our complex world, systems thinking is crucial, whether we're wrestling with global challenges or navigating our own personal workflows. [* ](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=6) Understanding the interconnectedness of systems is essential. [* ](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=17)

What does systems thinking entail? What tools for thought are you using to facilitate this process? OPD and OPL are ISO-standard modeling tools designed for systems thinking. [* ](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=39) After last week's video, some of you have commented on how you struggle with the practical application of concept modeling. [* ](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=47) I'll respond to that by modeling M personalities, popularized by Anor Leon, Nick Milo, and Thiago Forte, using OPM. [* ](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=56) Thus, my hope is to hit three birds with one stone: to teach the basics of OPD and OPL, to show how different tools are useful at different stages of our thinking, and to demonstrate how OPM can help us understand complex systems. [* ](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=73)

We'll start with a few questions. Now, if we were chatting over coffee, I'd wait for your reply and we'd have a discussion. [* ](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=91) But given our circumstances, I'm just going to pause shortly after each question, giving you time to come up with your own answer. [* ](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=103) But before we dive in, I just want to mention that you should definitely check out the video description; I included some helpful resources there should you wish to explore OPM further. [* ](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=111)

Now, the questions: What are the things that exist in the universe? [* ](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=126) What do we call them? The answer is objects; they are the things that exist or might exist. For example, a book is an object in OPD. [* ](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=130) Objects are nouns; they start with a capital letter and are represented with a square. [* ](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=145) What are the things that happen in the universe? The answer is processes; they are what happens or might happen. [* ](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=158) For example, reading is a process in OPD. [* ](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=164)

Processes are verbs in present participle form that end with "ing." They start with a capital letter and are represented with an ellipse. [* ](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=175) But processes cannot happen in a vacuum; they happen to something. [* ](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=187) Therefore, the follow-up question is, what are the things to which processes happen? [* ](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=193) The answer is that processes happen to objects; the things that happen occur to the things that exist. [* ](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=203) You represent this relationship with a line in OPD. [* ](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=207) 

There are a few different types of connections. The one I'm using here is the instrument relation; you read it as "reading requires a book." [* ](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=218) This sentence is the OPL representation of the OPD. [* ](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=229) Let's take a moment for a very important side note: the strength of OPM lies in its ability to facilitate dual-channel processing by grounding our understanding in both visual and textual formalism simultaneously. [* ](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=239) OPM enables us to engage our verbal and visual faculties at the same time, giving you twice the brain power, using all the cores of your CPU. [* ](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=254)

What do processes do to objects? The answer is that processes transform objects. [* ](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=268) But what does it mean for a process to transform an object? Transforming an object by a process means one of three possible things: the process can create an object, the process can destroy or consume an object, or a process can affect an object. [* ](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=277) For example, reading yields one or more fleeting notes or ideas. [* ](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=292) I use the term fleeting notes in reference to how to take smart notes by Zettelkasten. [* ](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=311) 

The arrow I'm using here is a procedural link that represents input, output, and results—in this case, output. [* ](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=318) The little plus sign next to the arrow is a participation constraint and denotes at least one. [* ](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=332) Our note-making process consumes at least one fleeting note and yields at least one note. [* ](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=340) But what does it mean for a process to affect an object? [* ](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=348) A process affects an object by changing its state. [* ](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=355)

So here we introduce, in addition to objects and processes, a third term, which is state. [* ](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=359) Objects must, therefore, be stateful; in other words, they must have states. [* ](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=366) Thus, we are talking about not just objects but stateful objects and processes that transform them. [* ](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=372) For example, a book can be unread or read, and reading changes the book from unread to read. [* ](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=384)

Now, let's shift gears and ask another question that we will need to answer later on: what are the two complementary aspects from which any system can be viewed? [* ](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=394) Two important, two key aspects: structure and behavior. [* ](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=402) Structure is the static aspect—it answers the question of what the system is made of, what are the parts, and how are they related. [* ](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=416) The second aspect, the complementary aspect, is behavior; it's the dynamic aspect that answers the question of how the system changes over time and what happens to the system and the objects in it. [* ](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=428) 

For example, a knowledge base consists of at least one catalog, many notes, many connections, and additional parts. [* ](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=446) A connection refers to two notes. [* ](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=457) The solid black arrowhead is a structural link and denotes aggregation or participation. [* ](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=460) When read in the other direction, the horizontal line between the arrowhead and the knowledge base denotes that the aggregation is not comprehensive. [* ](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=470) If the line were not there, we would assume the knowledge base only has these three components. [* ](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=482)

Additionally, a connection refers to one of the arrows between connection and note, which is called a tag; it is used to specify the nature of the relationship. [* ](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=488) Another example is the generalization structural relationship: video, blog, and book are content, and consuming generalizes reading and watching. [* ](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=499) Note that you could turn both of these sentences around. [* ](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=511) Thus, I could have said content generalizes video, blog, and books, and reading and watching are consuming. [* ](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=517) Generalization means that specialized elements inherit the properties of the generalized element. [* ](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=525)

Thus, we can also say that content can be unknown or known, and consuming changes content from unknown to known. [* ](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=536) Finally, there is an aspect that is only relevant to man-made systems. What is it? Well, it's the function or utilitarian subjective aspect that answers the question of why the system is built and for whom. [* ](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=548) This question holds significance solely within the realm of man-made systems as opposed to natural occurrences. [* ](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=569) 

But I can imagine that by now your head is spinning; we've covered a lot. [* ](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=578) Let's take a break and talk about learning languages. [* ](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=581) Similar to spoken languages, there are different modeling languages as well. [* ](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=585) Just as you use different languages to communicate with different people, you will use different modeling languages to represent different concepts. [* ](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=589) For example, BPMN for modeling business processes, UML for software design, ArcDown for argument modeling, Ibis for dialogue mapping, or DMN for decision modeling. [* ](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=600)

Just as there are many spoken languages, there are many modeling languages. [* ](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=615) However, the good news is that you don't need to learn them all to navigate through life. [* ](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=622) Nonetheless, you should at least learn one or two. [* ](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=629) Now, if you have ever tried to learn a language, you will know it's hard work, but once you've learned it, it opens doors to new cultures and perspectives. [* ](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=634) Mastering a modeling language offers a gateway to new insights and understanding. [* ](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=640) 

However, learning a modeling language is not as hard as learning a foreign language, but it still takes effort. [* ](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=646) Now, I don't want to bore you to death with my Object-Process Model of PKM; I'm going to share a link to it so you can explore and edit it in Excalidraw. [* ](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=666) I just want to highlight a few things before wrapping this video up. [* ](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=675) First, I want to clarify that I am also just learning OPM. [* ](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=681) I have watched all the videos I could find and spent a good five to six hours studying the OPM book. [* ](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=684) But please take my model with a grain of salt; I'm not a native OPD or OPL speaker, so my grammar, vocabulary, and accent are likely very rudimentary. [* ](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=690)

Because of this, I even created a dictionary for myself, just as you would when learning a foreign language. [* ](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=705) I will share a link to it in the video description; I hope you find it useful. [* ](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=714) Second, you will notice that I have four big circles on the map. [* ](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=721) This is OPD's solution for zooming in and out to different levels of abstraction. [* ](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=728) If the model becomes too complex, you can zoom in or out to view it at different levels of detail. [* ](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=736) On this map, architecting, curating, gardening, and authoring are the higher-level processes. [* ](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=740) 

This is how the model looks when I hide the details within these circles. [* ](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=752) To make this view even cleaner, I slightly reorganized elements and hid some of the structural decompositions by removing the breakdown of a PKM framework and the specialization of content. [* ](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=761) Third, this is not a flowchart. [* ](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=777) While there are processes in systems, real systems seldom operate in a sequential manner. [* ](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=780) Usually, there are concurrent, sometimes competing, and maybe probabilistic activities. [* ](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=785) 

However, to get a sense of order, the general rule is to read these models from top down. [* ](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=790) Finally, to address the comment about the practicality of all of this, let's discuss the architect, librarian, gardener, and writer within all of us. [* ](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=802) Based on my rudimentary OPM model, it is clear to me that it is not a question of either/or but rather these personalities playing in concert. [* ](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=815) Our journey in personal knowledge management starts with curating content, much like a librarian organizing books. [* ](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=829) But soon you'll realize the need to architect the system for storing notes and managing your backlog of content you've yet to explore. [* ](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=838)

This is where the architect in you takes charge. [* ](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=841) As your library grows, you'll find yourself gardening—organizing, sorting, and connecting ideas. [* ](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=854) Then it's time to create the right new steps forward. [* ](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=860) However, these roles don't exist in isolation; they are interconnected. [* ](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=862) The diagramming and modeling techniques we've discussed in recent videos are particularly helpful when your inner architect is at work. [* ](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=870)

In closing, I hope you found this introduction to Object-Process Modeling helpful.

[* ](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=885) Don't forget to check out the description below to find my dictionary and my OPD model of PKM. [* ](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=892) In case you were wondering, I used the Excalidraw plugin in Obsidian MD to create the illustrations for this video, as well as to run the slideshow. [* ](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=899) 

While there are many dedicated diagramming and modeling tools out there, the unique combination of free-form illustration and linked notes offered by the Excalidraw and Obsidian combo makes this my tool of choice for visual PKM. [* ](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=923) I'll include links in the description to my plugin as well as to my video about the slideshow script that I'm using. [* ](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=931) Additionally, there is a free OPM modeling tool called OPCAT available. [* ](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=938) The tool is a bit dated as it requires Java Runtime Environment, and you will need to Google for the OPCAT download since the download link on the official website is broken. [* ](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=946) However, it is useful for learning the grammar. [* ](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=959) I'll include the link to the official website in the description. [* ](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=963) Until next time, thanks for watching. This is Zsolt signing off. [* ](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=969)

In this video, I explore the Object-Process Methodology (OPM) within the realm of Personal Knowledge Management (PKM). Systems Thinking is essential in our complex world, and OPM provides a tool to facilitate it. Through OPM, I demonstrate the interconnectedness of objects and processes in our PKM system using the Architect, Librarian, Gardener, and Writer analogy introduced by Anne-Laure Le Cunff, Nick Milo, and Tiago Forte. I show how these roles/processes affect each other within PKM. Utilizing visual and textual formalisms simultaneously, OPM facilitates a deeper understanding of complex systems. I break down the basics of OPD and OPL, showcasing their practical application in modeling PKM Personalities.

the](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=135) [things that exist or might](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=138) [exist for example a book is an object in](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=141) [OPD objects are nouns they start with a](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=145) [capital letter and are represented with](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=149) [a](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=152) [square what are the things that happen](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=154) [in the](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=158) [universe the answer is the processes are](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=160) [what happen or might](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=164) [happen for example reading is a process](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=166) [in OPD processes are verbs in present](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=171) [participle form that is ending with ing](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=175) [they start with a capital letter and are](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=180) [represented with an](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=182) [ellipse but processes cannot happen in](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=184) [vacuum they happen to](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=187) [something therefore the follow-up](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=191) [question is what are the things to which](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=193) [processes](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=197) [happen the answer is that processes](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=201) [happen to objects the things that happen](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=203) [happen to the things that exist](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=207) [you represent this relationship with a](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=210) [line in OPD there are a few different](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=213) [type of connections the one I'm using](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=216) [here is the instrument relation you read](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=218) [it as reading requires a](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=222) [book this

side note the strength of OPM](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=235) [lies in its ability to facilitate ual](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=239) [Channel processing by grounding our](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=242) [understanding in both Visual and textual](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=246) [formalism](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=249) [simultaneously OPM enables us to engage](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=250) [our verbal and visual faculties at the](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=254) [same time giving you twice the brain](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=257) [power using all the cores of your](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=260) [CPU what do processes do to](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=265) [objects](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=268) [the answer is that processes transform](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=271) [objects but what does it mean for a](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=277) [process to transform an](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=280) [object transforming an object by a](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=283) [process means one of three possible](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=286) [things the process can create an](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=288) [object the process can destroy or](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=292) [consume an object and a process can](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=295) [affect an](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=299) [object for example reading yields one or](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=300) [more fleeting notes or ideas I use the](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=305) [term fleeting noes in reference to how](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=308) [to take smart nodes by zun arens the](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=311) [arrow I'm using here is a

[plus sign next to the arrow is a](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=325) [participation con strain and denotes at](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=328) [least](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=332) [one in turn our note making process](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=333) [consumes at least one fleeting note and](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=337) [yields at least one](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=340) [note but what does it mean for a process](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=344) [to affect an](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=348) [object a process affects an object by](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=351) [changing its state so here we introduce](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=355) [in addition addition to objects and](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=359) [processes a third term which is State](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=361) [objects must therefore be stateful in](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=366) [other words they must have States thus](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=369) [we are talking about not just objects](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=372) [but stateful objects and processes that](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=376) [transform them for example a book can be](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=379) [unread or read and reading changes the](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=384) [book from unread to](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=388) [Red now let's shift gears and ask](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=390) [another question that we will need to](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=394) [answer later](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=397) [on what are the two complementary](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=398) [aspects from which any system can be](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=402) [viewed two important two key](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=404) [aspects the two key aspects are](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=410) [structure and behavior structure is the](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=413) [static aspect it answers the question](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=416) [question what is the system made of what](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=419) [are the parts and how are they](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=422) [related the second aspect the](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=426) [complementary aspect is the behavior](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=428) [it's the dynamic aspect that answers the](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=432) [question how does the system change over](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=435) [time what happens to the system and the](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=438) [objects in](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=441) [it so for example a knowledge base](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=443) [consists of at least one catalog many](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=446) [notes many connections and additional](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=449) [parts and a connection refers to two](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=453) [notes the solid black Arro head is a](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=457) [structural link and denotes aggregation](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=460) [or participation when readed in the](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=464) [other direction the horizontal line](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=466) [between the arroe head and the knowledge](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=470) [base denotes that the aggregation is not](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=472) [comprehensive if the line were not there](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=476) [we would assume the knowledge base only](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=479) [has these three](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=482) [components additionally refers to on the](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=484) [Arrow between connection and note is](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=488) [called a tag it is used to specify the](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=490) [nature of the](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=494) [relationship another example is the](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=496) [generalization structural](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=499) [relationship video blog and book are](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=501) [content and consuming generalizes](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=505) [reading and watching note that you could](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=508) [turn both of these sentences around thus](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=511) [I could have said content generalizes](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=514) [video blog and books and reading and](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=517) [watching are](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=520) [consuming generalization means that](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=522) [specialized element inherit the](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=525) [properties of the generalized element](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=528) [thus we can also say that content can be](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=532) [unknown or known and consuming changes](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=536) [content from unknown to](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=540) [known finally there is an aspect that is](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=545) [only relevant to man-made systems what](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=548) [is](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=552) [it well it's the function or utilitarian](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=554) [subjective aspect that answers the](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=557) [question why is the system built and for](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=560) [whom this question holds significance](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=563) [solely within the realm of man-made](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=567) [systems as opposed to Natural](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=569) [occurrences but I can imagine that by](https://youtu.be/se7odslzd5U?t=572) [now your
