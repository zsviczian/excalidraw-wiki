Hey everyone, welcome to my quick review of Annie Murphy Paul's book, *The Extended Mind*, which I created as part of the second cohort of the visual thinking workshop. [* ](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=0) Our story begins here: over the last 100 years, IQ levels globally have increased significantly, by up to 30 IQ points. [* ](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=12) However, some research suggests that this upward trajectory is leveling off over the last 10 to 20 years. [* ](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=20) The question is, how can we continue to grow? We need to solve extremely complex problems, such as climate change or the AI revolution. [* ](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=33) How can we become more intelligent?

Annie Murphy Paul's argument in the book is that it is the stuff outside our heads that makes us smart. [* ](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=49) This includes embodied cognition, meaning gestures and movements; situated cognition, which includes our environment where we sit; and distributed cognition, which means the people that we talk to, the people that we meet, and the ones that we interact with. [* ](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=61) The image that Annie starts her book with is of a nest-building bird, like a magpie, who builds her nest from whatever parts she is able to find. [* ](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=79) Similarly, our brains use other people, the physical spaces we are in, and our feelings and movements to combine all these into thoughts. [* ](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=94) Thinking outside our heads means skillfully engaging these entities and drawing them into our thinking process.

I'm going to cover three points in this summary. [* ](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=115) First, our brains are context-sensitive. [* ](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=120) Second, we are social creatures. [* ](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=126) Finally, we will talk about habits you can adopt to improve your thinking. [* ](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=129)

So, what does it mean that our brain is context-sensitive? [* ](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=134) It means a couple of things. First, it is useful to re-embody information. [* ](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=140) For example, it is well known that Einstein liked to run thought experiments where he imagined being a light beam traveling at the speed of light, contemplating what is happening around him. [* ](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=147) This embodiment of the thought created a new perspective that helped him understand physical reality better. [* ](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=162)

One good approach is to enact concepts; try to stand up and move around to make the concepts spatial, which can help you understand them better. [* ](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=171) Seek to bring your entire body into the thinking process. For example, attend to the gestures of other people and use that to understand the concepts better. [* ](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=196) Finally, listen to your own body, to your feelings and heartbeat, and pay attention to your interoceptive signals to better understand the decisions that you want to make. [* ](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=210)

Secondly, specialized information is crucial. [* ](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=220) The Memory Palace, or the method of loci, is a memory technique used by memory champions. [* ](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=223) It involves imagining a location that you know very well—maybe your home or office—and walking through that virtual space in your mind, attaching each element you want to remember to specific locations along that journey. [* ](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=238) When you mentally rehearse walking through the area, you can recall information much better. [* ](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=254)

We all create mental maps, which is the basic method of our brain. [* ](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=271) We use our spatial capabilities to create maps of conceptual items, reflected in our language; for example, we reach for lofty goals or look at the future that lies ahead of us, and think of the past behind us. [* ](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=283) You can enhance this process by creating mind maps, concept maps, diagrams, charts, or tables, which will help you understand information better and externalize that information. [* ](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=316)

Finally, we should aim to socialize information in a social context. [* ](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=318) We will think differently, so one way to socialize information is to debate it with others or seek synchronicity and cooperation. [* ](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=328) Synchronicity means being on the same wavelength. [* ](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=341) For example, a group of people eating lunch together may experience higher synchronicity. [* ](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=346) Sharing a spicy meal will increase this low-level connection; thus, activities like karaoke or hiking together can also be beneficial. [* ](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=366)

Another approach to socializing information is to teach others. [* ](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=378) Of course, the age-old method of storytelling is key, as all these methods help create a context where we can be more creative and intelligent. [* ](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=384)

Second, we are social creatures, which has several consequences to pay attention to. [* ](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=393) For example, try to embed extensions in your everyday environment. [* ](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=401) Place a family photo or other cues of identity on your desk to create an environment for your brain where it feels at home, which will help you focus. [* ](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=413) Add green indoor plants, as they can restore our attention; humans have naturally evolved to live outdoors, and green environments help recharge our minds more effectively. [* ](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=429)

Build transactive memory systems, meaning that groups of people will remember more together than individuals alone. [* ](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=455) You may not recall specific information, but you'll know whom to ask to get the needed information. [* ](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=463) This interdependence among people, called a transactive memory system, is beneficial. [* ](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=489) Lastly, aim for stability, as we are much more creative and productive in stable environments. [* ](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=494)

Create situations that trigger the desired type of thinking. [* ](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=515) Teach others, explain concepts, and encourage informal spaces in offices for casual discussions. [* ](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=519) Research shows that best practices are often shared better through social chit-chat than formal training. [* ](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=548) Aim to share meals, go on hikes as a group, and participate in karaoke, which will create collaborative environments leading to synchronicity within the team. [* ](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=556)

Finally, recognize that we are looping creatures, meaning our thinking process is not linear. [* ](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=571) We can take an idea, put it on paper or share it with others, and see how that influences our thinking. [* ](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=577) Look for ways to loop your ideas outside your mind, such as creating spatial loops with Post-its or whiteboards. [* ](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=603) Looping with others helps share ideas, as does sensing and labeling your own feelings to improve your mindset. [* ](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=626)

If you're not skilled at listening to your feelings, consider keeping an interoceptive journal or doing body scan meditation. [* ](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=640) Now, let's discuss some habits to adopt based on all this information. [* ](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=664) First, the habit of offloading and externalizing is important. [* ](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=668) Offload to templates, which relieve some cognitive burden, allowing you to focus on content instead of format. [* ](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=674) You can also offload to a whiteboard, which allows for an external perspective known as the detachment gain. [* ](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=691)

Try to gesture as much as possible; there are symbolic gestures that represent ideas and beat gestures that add rhythm to your talk. [* ](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=703) Practice continuous offloading to a diary. Annie's recommended approach is creating a decision log—write down decisions, list options, and reflect on your feelings regarding each option. [* ](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=714) After making a decision, review your notes to see how your feelings correlated with the outcome. [* ](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=749)

Lastly, practice social offloading, which can involve debates or using transactive memory systems and collaboration. [* ](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=764) Aim to transform abstract thoughts into tangible items that you can touch, feel, and move around. [* ](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=778) Finally, deliberately alter your state before doing mental labor. [* ](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=794) For example, research showed that people sitting outside a box were able to come up with 20 more creative ideas than those sitting inside a box. [* ](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=803)

Additionally, eating spicy food with your colleagues can significantly increase synchronicity, leading to better collaboration. [* ](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=831) Move your body, as movement helps memory retention; actors remember lines better by attaching them to their movements. [* ](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=844) Utilize physical exercise to alter your mental state—light exercise can increase alertness and memory capabilities, while intense exercise may shift your brain to a more dreamlike state, leading to big-picture thinking. [* ](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=865)

In summary, it is the stuff outside our heads that makes us smart. [* ](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=910) By being deliberate about using embodied cognition, situated cognition, and distributed cognition, you can achieve much better results, enhancing your intelligence, productivity, and creativity, both individually and as a group. [* ](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=924) This brief summary covered our brains being context-sensitive, the concept of social creatures, and habits worth adopting. [* ](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=935) The book is rich and filled with many examples, of which I provided a high-level overview of the key concepts. [* ](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=949) If you are interested in this topic, I highly recommend picking up a copy of Annie Murphy Paul's book, *The Extended Mind*. [* ](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=973) You will not regret it; it's a well-written, interesting, and detailed book. [* ](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=982)

Additionally, if you would like, registrations are now open for the third cohort of the visual thinking workshop. [* ](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=985) If you register before the 5th of March, you will receive the early bird prize of $100 off the full price, and cohort 3 will start on the 25th of March. [* ](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=990) Thank you! [* ](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=1005)

[skillfully engage these entities outside](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=107) [our heads and we draw them in to our](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=110) [thinking process I'm going to cover](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=113) [three points in this summary first of](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=115) [all that our brains are context](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=118)

[your home your office and walking](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=235) [through that virtual space in your mind](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=238) [and attaching each of the elements you](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=241) [want to remember to a certain location](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=244) [along that journey and by this when you](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=246) [mentally rehearse walking through this](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=251) [area and you remember that yes I left](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=254) [this card at the stairs I left that card](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=257) [with the receptionist Etc you will be](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=261) [able to recall information much better](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=264) [second we all create mental Maps](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=267) [actually this is the basic method of our](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=271) [brain](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=273) [using our spatial capabilities to create](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=274) [maps of conceptual items this is for](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=278) [example reflected in our language](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=281) [because we reach for a lofty goal the](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=283) [look at the future that lies ahead of us](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=287) [we think of the past behind us and so on](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=290) [so we conceptualize ideas and Abstract](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=294) [Concepts in a spatial Manner and you can](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=297) [help this process by creating mind maps](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=300) [concept Maps or any other diagrams or](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=303) [even charts and tables this will all](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=307) [help you get a better understanding of](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=311) [information and will help you](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=313) [externalize that information](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=316) [and finally we should aim to socialize](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=318) [information in a social context we are](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=322) [going to be thinking differently so one](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=325) [way to socialize information is to](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=328) [debate the information with others or to](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=331) [seek synchronicity and cooperation with](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=334) [others synchronicity means that you are](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=338) [on the same wavelength so for example](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=341) [here you can see a group of people](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=343) [eating lunch together and you can see](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=346) [the pepper and the bottom right corner](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=348) [just very small that represents that](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=351) [eating spicy food together and feeling](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=353) [the heat together will increase the](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=357) [level of synchronicity that's why for](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=360) [example doing karaoke or going on a hike](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=362) [together is also very useful because our](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=366) [bodies will move together and that](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=369) [improves synchronicity](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=371) [another approach you can use to](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=373) [socialize information is to teach others](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=375) [and of course the age-old approach of](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=378) [telling stories is a key tool in this](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=381) [and all of these methods help us create](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=384) [a context where we are able to be more](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=387) [creative and more intelligent](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=391) [second we are social creatures and this](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=393) [has a number of consequences that you](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=396) [should pay attention to so first of all](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=398) [try to embed extensions into our](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=401) [everyday environment](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=404) [for example place a family photo or some](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=406) [other cues of identity on your desk](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=410) [because that is going to create an](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=413) [environment for your brain where your](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=415) [brain feels at home and will be in the](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=417) [context of work or whatever you want to](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=420) [do at that table](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=423) [add green indoor plants because that is](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=425) [going to restore our attention we have](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=429) [naturally evolved to live outdoors our](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=432) [ancestors lived on the Savannah and our](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=434) [minds are restored by seeing the green](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=437) [environment it's just much easier for](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=440) [our minds to process this type of](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=443) [information and if you have green plants](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=445) [in your environment that is going to](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=447) [help you be more relaxed and to recharge](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=449) [faster](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=453) [build transactive memory systems this](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=455) [sounds very fancy this means that a](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=458) [group of people together will remember](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=460) [more than individuals alone because you](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=463) [will not remember the information](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=466) [specifically I'm not going to know the](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=468) [name of the system or the person I need](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=471) [to talk to or the title of the website](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=474) [but I know which colleague or which](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=477) [friend I should ask and I know that I'm](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=479) [going to get that information and this](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=482) [sort of](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=484) [interdependence between people in a](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=486) [group is what's called a transactive](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=489) [memory system and finally aim for](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=491) [stability we are much more creative we](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=494) [are much more productive in a stable](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=498) [environment so even if you're working in](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=500) [an office where there are hot desks try](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=503) [to speak the same hot desk every day](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=506) [because that stability is going to](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=508) [improve your level of performance](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=511) [second create situations that trigger](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=515) [the desired type of thinking so for](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=519) [example teach others and explain and](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=522) [through that you're going to learn](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=526) [yourself](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=528) [create informal spaces in offices where](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=529) [people can chit chat and it might look](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=533) [like it's just meaningless chit chat but](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=535) [research has shown that the corporate](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=539) [processes the best practices are shared](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=543) [much better through social Chit Chat](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=546) [than through formal trainings and](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=548) [finally](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=551) [aim to share a meal hike as a group do](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=552) [karaoke be](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=556) [together with the team and that is going](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=558) [to create an environment for](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=562) [collaborative work where you're going to](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=564) [be in sync with the team](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=567) [and finally recognize that we are loopy](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=571) [creatures this means that our thinking](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=574) [is not like we take an idea and we think](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=577) [about it and we have an output but we](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=580) [take an idea we put it on paper we put](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=582) [it on the wall we share it with others](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=586) [we](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=588) [play with the idea and then we look at](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=589) [what we've played with and that will](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=592) [then influence our thinking so look for](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=594) [ways to Loop your ideas outside your](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=598) [mind with others and approaches for that](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=600) [are to create spatial Loops by for](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=603) [example using Post-its or a whiteboard](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=606) [and placing the information on a wall or](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=609) [by talking to other people so looping](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=612) [with other people helps share ideas](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=614) [and loop with your own feelings so sense](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=618) [your feelings label them and re-appraise](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=622) [your feelings and that is going to help](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=626) [get you into a different mindset and](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=629) [help you interpret this information](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=631) [better if you're not skilled at](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=634) [listening to your own feelings then](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=637) [there are a couple of approaches that](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=639) [you can take to improve so for example](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=640) [keeping an interceptive Journal can help](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=643) [in this but also doing a body scan](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=647) [meditation can help when you meditate](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=650) [and you just simply reflect on the](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=654) [feelings that you feel in your body](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=657) [and finally what are some habits to](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=661) [adopt based on all of this information](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=664) [so first of all](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=666) [the habit of offloading and](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=668) [externalizing is important you can](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=671) [offload to templates because if you fill](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=674) [out a template then you lose the](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=677) [cognitive burden of thinking about the](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=680) [format and you can focus your attention](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=683) [on the content you can offload to a](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=686) [whiteboard which will have the](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=689) [additional benefit of having an external](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=691) [perspective called the Detachment gain](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=694) [because you can observe your ideas as if](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=697) [they were external](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=701) [try to gesture as much as possible there](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=703) [are actually two type of gestures there](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=706) [are the symbolic gestures when your](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=708) [gesture](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=711) [represents an idea and there are just](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=712) [simply the beat gestures that give your](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=715) [talk a bit of a rhythm](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=719) [practice continuous offloading to a](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=722) [diary the approach recommended by Annie](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=725) [and her book is to create a decision log](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=728) [write down the decision that you need to](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=731) [make list the different options and then](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=734) [listen to your body and reflect on how](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=737) [you feel by each of these and write](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=740) [those feelings down and then after the](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=743) [decision or after you see the outcome of](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=747) [the decision that you finally made go](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=749) [back to your notes and check how your](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=752) [feelings correlated to the outcome so](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=755) [you can learn from listening to your](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=759) [feelings in your next decision](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=761) [and finally practice social offloading](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=764) [which can be debate but it can also be](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=767) [the transactive memory system or it can](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=770) [be collaboration with others](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=772) [aim to transform information and](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=775) [abstract thoughts into tangible items](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=778) [that you can touch and feel move around](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=782) [and look at this is going to](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=784) [significantly help your cognition and](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=787) [understanding](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=790) [finally deliberately alter your own](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=792) [State before doing mental labor so the](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=794) [thing here with the boxes there was an](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=797) [experiment where researchers ask people](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=800) [to sit inside the box and they asked](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=803) [other people to sit next to a box and](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=807) [then they gave them](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=810) [a problem and people had to come up with](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=812) [creative ideas those people who were](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=815) [sitting outside the box were able to](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=818) [come up with 20 more creative ideas than](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=820) [those people who were sitting inside the](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=824) [Box](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=826) [second go and eat some spicy food with](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=828) [your colleagues this experience is going](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=831) [to significantly increase your](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=834) [synchronicity and it will help you](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=837) [collaborate better](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=839) [third get up and move](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=841) [actors remember their lines because](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=844) [they're able to attach what they're](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=846) [saying to movements that they're doing](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=849) [the same way if you get up and move that](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=852) [is going to help your memory but it's](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=855) [also going to help you explain Concepts](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=857) [better to others](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=860) [and finally use physical exercise to](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=862) [alter your mental state there are two](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=865) [things to pay attention here first when](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=867) [you're doing light exercise that is](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=870) [going to increase your level of](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=873) [alertness it's going to improve your](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=875) [memory capabilities but then second](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=877) [if you're doing very intense exercise](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=882) [that is going to move your brain to](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=884) [another state it's going to be a more](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=887) [dreamlike State and you're going to have](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=890) [a different type of thought you're not](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=893) [going to be able to think in logical](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=895) [detail because you will not have the](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=898) [brain capacity for that but you're going](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=900) [to see the big picture and that is going](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=903) [to help come up with Creative Solutions](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=905) [so in summary it is the stuff outside](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=910) [our heads that makes us smart and by](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=913) [being deliberate about using embodied](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=916) [cognition situated cognition and](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=918) [distributed cognition you can achieve](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=921) [much better results you can become as a](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=924) [group together with others but also](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=927) [yourself more intelligent more](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=930) [productive more creative](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=932) [so that is my brief summary of the book](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=935) [we talked about the brain being context](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=938) [sensitive then we explored the idea of](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=941) [us being social creatures and finally we](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=944) [looked at couple of habits that are](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=947) [worth to adopt](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=949) [the book is very rich it's filled with](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=952) [lots and lots and lots of examples here](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=955) [I made a deliberate choice to only give](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=958) [you a very high level walkthrough of the](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=961) [key Concepts that I took away from the](https://youtu.be/oXMKF8zqG6E?t=965) [book if you're interested in this
