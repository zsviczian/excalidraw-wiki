![ExcaliBrain is transforming how I use Obsidian.md](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM)

# Summary
In this video, the speaker introduces Excalibrane, a tool designed to visualize the hierarchy within an Obsidian vault. It combines features from existing applications like the Brain and the Breadcrumbs plugin, allowing users to create a comprehensive and interactive mind map based on their markdown files. The speaker also discusses how Excalibrane has transformed their personal knowledge management practices by improving the organization and navigation of information.

# Key Takeaways
- Excalibrane visualizes the hierarchy of information within Obsidian using plugins that enhance user interactivity and automation.
- The tool allows for multiple types of relationships (parent, child, friend, sibling) to be displayed, which helps in organizing and contextualizing knowledge more effectively.
- Excalibrane integrates with other plugins and data views, facilitating a richer navigation experience and better structuring of content in personal knowledge management systems.

# Content
Hey everyone, today I'd like to talk to you about Excalibrane, explain to you what Excalibrane is, and show you how it is transforming the way I'm using Obsidian. [* ](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=0) 

So let's start with the question: what is Excalibrane? First of all, Excalibrane was inspired by two different inputs. One is the Brain application, which I've used for almost two decades and has really been transformational in the way I think about personal knowledge management and graph databases. The second is the Breadcrumbs plugin, which introduced the use of data view fields to create directional links in your Obsidian database. It has provided me with ideas on how I could convert my markdown documents in Obsidian into a graph that looks very much like the Brain application does. [* ](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=15)

So, Excalibrane is based on two plugins for its architecture. Partly, it is based on Excalidraw, and Excalidraw is simply the engine behind displaying the graph. I made this design choice because I wanted to experiment with the automation capabilities of Excalidraw, and I'm hoping that maybe some other developers get inspired by the possibilities of automating with Excalidraw, and we will see other cool plugins and capabilities built around Excalidraw in Obsidian. Using Excalidraw for visualization creates an opportunity to easily create a snapshot of your graph in Excalibrane and then continue to edit it in Excalidraw. [* ](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=70)

Excalibrane is based on Obsidian Data View, and Data View is the underlying engine that provides insights such as the fields in the document that I use to create the graph displayed by Excalibrane. To answer the question "what is Excalibrane?", my simplest answer is that it is a tool to visualize hierarchy in your vault. I have talked about the LATCH principle a number of times; LATCH stands for Location, Alphabet, Time, Category, and Hierarchy. [* ](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=158)

LATCH was a term that I read about in "Information Anxiety," a book by Richard Saul Wurman. In short, these five principles that are part of the LATCH framework are the five basic ways to organize information. There is really no other way if you think about it. My advocacy is that when you map your knowledge in your personal knowledge management system, you should make every effort to map information against all of these categories. I have several different videos on these topics of using map view or your daily notes to structure your information. [* ](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=218)

With a bit of a longer definition, Excalibrane is an interactive structured mind map of your Obsidian vault. It is generated based on the folders and files in your vault and the links, data view fields, tags, and YAML front matter in your markdown files. Looking a bit more into what you will see on an Excalibrane graph view, there are different relationships displayed. Nodes have children, they have parents, lateral connections (which I call friends), and nodes have siblings as well. [* ](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=250)

If we look at the spatial representation, then the node is at the center, which is the document that is currently open and active. Children are below that node, parents are above, friends are to the left, and siblings are to the right. If we look here, you can see that this document, the drawing that we're talking about, has a number of children, it has one lateral node or a friend node, and it has three parents. At the moment, I have siblings turned off, but if I turn on siblings, then you see that there are a number of siblings. The siblings are the children of the parent nodes. [* ](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=290)

In this case, I have many siblings because I'm displaying the tag category as well. The Excalidraw tag has a number of drawings. If I hide the tag, then the number of siblings will decrease because now I'm not looking at the Excalidraw drawings in my documents, only looking at the children of these objects. For example, the children of this folder are the attachments and the video folder, and the children of the Obsidian Excalibrane folder are the documents that we saw when I started this presentation. [* ](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=350)

Looking at these relationships, you will see that some nodes are blue, some are white, and some are yellow. You can customize the look and feel, and I'll talk about this customization in just a second. Getting back to our drawing, the last question I want to touch upon in answering the question "what is Excalibrane?" is how relationships are derived. There are two types of relationships: explicit and inferred relationships. Explicit relationships are the easier ones. These are specified using data view fields; inferred relationships are relationships where there is not a specific data view field explaining what the relationship between two nodes is, but I'm making an assumption based on how these links are placed. [* ](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=400)

If you have a file that has a forward link to another file, I consider the file with the forward link to be the parent and the linked file to be the child. If there's a backlink to a file, I infer that the document with the backlink is the parent of the document. If I have two files that mutually point at each other, then I consider the relationship to be lateral and treat them as friends. The simplest one is the siblings, because the children of all the parents are my siblings. Let's look at some of these on this graph. [* ](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=474)

I'm going to turn off siblings now, and you can see that today's date is a friend of this drawing. If I open today's daily notes page, then you will see that I have a data view field called "working on," and I have the link "what is Excalibrane." By placing this data view field, I give additional information to Excalibrane to figure out what that relationship is like. If I go to Excalibrane settings, then you will see that there are different fields that describe a friend relationship. One of those fields is the "working on" field. [* ](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=550)

If I look at the graph, then you will see in this case that "Sunday" is represented with white letters. This signifies that it is an explicitly defined relationship. The letters here, like "Obsidian Data View," are inferred relationships, and they are children. The reason is simple. You can see that I have "Obsidian Data View" right here. If I open this, you can see I have a link to "Obsidian Data View," and therefore Excalibrane infers that Data View is a child of this node. Similarly, I have "Obsidian Excalibrane" up here, which is a parent of "What is Excalibrane." If I navigate to this node and look at the document itself, you will see that this document has several children, one of which is the "What is Excalibrane" document. That's how this relationship becomes explicitly defined. [* ](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=650)

Now moving on to the second question: how has Excalibrane transformed the way I use Obsidian? There are several different ways that is happening, so let me start with the topic of typifying relationships, and I've already shared quite a bit about this in the previous couple of minutes. The way you typify relationships is using data view fields, which are very simple to create. You type in a couple of words at the beginning of a paragraph or a row in your document and finish it with a double colon, and that becomes a field. For example, "from" followed by inspired by author; these are different fields. You can see that I have different types of fields and relationships. We saw this in settings a moment ago, but just to dive a bit deeper here. [* ](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=678)

Some of my parent relationships are based on "author," "source," "inspired by," and "from." Using these different words helps contextualize the text I write in the document. For example, here you can see that "LATCH" is from "Information Anxiety." It is referred to on page 69, and in Excalibrane, this is the relationship that you saw also a couple of minutes ago. My literature notes about "Information Anxiety" are on top, and "LATCH" is on the bottom. I know the type of relationship. Child relationships are, for example, "supports" or "consists of." Friend or lateral relationships might include similar terms like "sponsored," "date started," and "finished working on"; these are all ways to express a lateral relationship. [* ](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=770)

I also have directional relationships, so it makes a difference if I have two files, file A and file B, and which one has the data view field. Based on this, I can create directed relationships. For example, I have "Obsidian Excalibrane" inspired by "the Brain" and "Breadcrumbs." You can see that the graph will look like this; the "Brain" and "Breadcrumbs" are parents of Excalibrane because they are the inspiration, and you also see a direction of the arrow. In settings, you set this up by defining the "inspired by" relationship, and you can select "inspired by" from this drop-down list and add your own customization for how that link should look. [* ](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=834)

Using Excalibrane has helped me move to more atomic nodes. If I don't have atomic notes, I end up with a very cluttered view of the graph. This is because everything is linked directly to the document. The way to overcome this is to use embeds much more strategically. This also means that I've started to use the Node Refactor plugin, which is a great tool to cut a larger document into smaller parts, and I've also applied a bit of CSS magic. I'm happy to share this piece of CSS; it's nothing very complex. All this does is when I embed a document into a page in Obsidian, for example, like in this case, this is an example of how I manage meetings and meeting notes. [* ](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=916)

You can see that in this document, it's a bit hard to see the darker color, but "Bob the Builder" is part of my daily notes page, but everything below Bob is a transclusion. Along with Bob's page, I have another transclusion for "Project K," and you can see the continuing content right there. The same goes with "Project B"; this is still in the core daily notes page, but then the notes under it for my meeting that they are transcluded. I'll put the link to this video; it's called "It's About Time," and you can learn more about how I manage my daily notes and these meeting notes. [* ](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1000)

What I want to show you here is that as a result, my Excalibrane layout looks much simpler. Don't look at the dashed lines; this is my demo database, and it's all configured for different tests. But what I want to show you is that the Thursday document has only a couple of links. Some links here include "Bob the Builder" and "Project B." The reason they are inferred friends is that, on Bob's page, I have the link back to Thursday, as I have the link to Bob here on the daily notes page. That's why it's also blue because it's an inferred link. I personally prefer that in the case of my daily notes, all of the notes I'm taking are considered to be lateral connections rather than a child of that day. [* ](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1070)

If I want to change this, I could add a data view field here and specify the relationship. I can even add a data view field in front of a transclusion, so that would also work. The point I want to make right here is that I have a much less cluttered view because, here, you can see a reference to "Mock," and you can see a reference to "Project K," as well as a reference to "Rolly" and "Project C." You have all these references that do not show on this diagram; I would need to navigate into "Project B" or "Bob" to see those details. [* ](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1101)

Now moving on to the other huge benefit of using Excalibrane: virtual notes. Virtual notes are links to files that haven't been created yet. Virtual notes suddenly have a role in navigating my graph. In this case, I can navigate to "Tag Wrangler," which is an awesome Obsidian plugin; if you want to manage your tags, I recommend trying Tag Wrangler. What I want to show you is that I reference "Tag Wrangler" under the "Obsidian Plugins" document as a child, and I also reference "Tag Wrangler" under my storyboard for gardening in my vault. There, it is referenced as a friend relationship. In Excalibrane, I am able to click on this virtual note, which is a note that doesn't have a file yet, and I can see the relationships: the parent and friend relationship as well. [* ](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1189)

I think this is really very helpful and cool. I've found that I have lots of virtual notes in my vault, and I've suddenly started to see connections between different parts of my vault through these uncreated documents. Finally, I think Excalibrane is also very cool. In my personal experience, it has started to take over the navigation of my vault. Instead of using the file navigator here or the file explorer and instead of using the tag pane, I'm using Excalibrane to navigate through my folders, tags, notes, and virtual notes seamlessly in one integrated experience. [* ](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1205)

All of these different structures—the tag trees, the folder hierarchies, and the node connections—suddenly come to life and provide me with much richer context in my Obsidian vault. Finally, I just wanted to quickly show you around the Excalibrane settings, so you get a better sense of what types of settings you can adjust. First, at the top, you see I have a setting for the file path of the Excalibrane drawing. This is a consequence of my design decision to use Excalidraw as the engine for Excalibrane. This means I must have a file in my vault that is open when I'm navigating Excalibrane; it is just a document, an Excalidraw document, with some automation. You can specify the file you want to use for that; the default is "excalibrane.md," but you might want to call it something else or place it in another location. [* ](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1255)

Next, you can define the different hierarchies, which can be the parents, children, and friends. Here, you need to provide a comma-separated list of data view fields that you want to use to define the type of relationship a certain note has to another node. I have a couple of display options; by the way, most of these display options are now included as buttons at the top of Excalibrane under the search bar. You have some file paths that you might want to exclude; for example, you could put your templates folder here. At the moment, it's empty for me, but I should probably really put a "templater" folder here so that Excalibrane will exclude it from its indexing and display all my templates and it won't clutter my views. [* ](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1351)

Then you have all these different types of relationships; each of these has a button. You can hide virtual nodes, folders, tags, etc. You have several options. You can also display or hide attachments and don't need to go into settings, as you can actually do this with these buttons right here, providing convenient and easy access. There is a maximum number of nodes to display as children or friends or whatever of a node. This is because some notes have potentially hundreds of links, and you end up with a very cluttered view. My mindset is I'm looking for a simple, easy-to-understand graph, and I think that if I have more than 40 items as children or siblings on it, it's not going to be useful anyway. I need to create atomic notes; I need to make it more structured. You can set this number to whatever you like; you can go up to 150 if you want. I keep it at a fairly low number of 40. [* ](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1456)

Then you can style components; you can set the canvas color and the style of different types of nodes. Nodes get their style based on their type, so you have the inferred nodes, the virtual nodes, the nodes in the center (that's called the central node), you have siblings and attachments and folders. These are some built-in types of nodes, but also if you add categories to pages, you can define these relationships based on various parameters. [* ](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1484)

Lastly, I have this feature to pin the document to a specific pane. It is a bit tricky, but if I navigate to a file here, for example to "splunking," if I open this document, then the graph navigates to this page as well. If I navigate to something else on this side, for example to "unicycling," again the graph changes. Some people find this a bit confusing because all the different panes are changing. You can pin Excalibrane to one pane, and the way you do it is by selecting this workspace and clicking the pin button. From now on, as I'm navigating here, it will always change that view, and if I navigate to a document here, it will not change this view. This allows Excalibrane to listen only to this workspace. [* ](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1768)

The last thing I want to show you is this pencil button. If I press this pencil, the drawing is open in a new pane, which allows editing. If I want, I can save it with a different name. You see it receives a name automatically, which is a snapshot of my graph view on the right-hand side. This is useful if you want to create snapshots and add some additional content around those snapshots. [* ](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1887)

So that was all I wanted to share with you today. Let me just again convert this into a hover editor and make this full screen. Let's just get back to what Excalibrane is. In today's video, we talked about what Excalibrane is and what it's based on, and we also looked at how it has started to transform the way I use Obsidian. I hope you found this presentation helpful and I hope that this has helped you learn more about Excalibrane. Excalibrane right now is not yet available in the community plug-in store; you need to use Obsidian Beta to install it. I will link the video that explains how to do that in the description. If you want to install it, it is really just a couple of clicks; it's not very hard, and with that video, you will be able to install Excalibrane for yourself. [* ](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1977) Thank you!

displayed](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=276) [nodes have children they have parents](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=278) [there are lateral connections i call](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=282) [friends](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=284) [and nodes have siblings as well](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=285) [if we look at the](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=290) [spatial representation then the node is](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=293) [at the center that is the document that](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=297) [is currently open and active](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=299) [children are below that node parents are](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=302) [above](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=305) [friends are to the left and siblings are](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=306) [to the right so if we look here](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=309) [you can see](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=313) [that](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=314) [this](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=315) [document the drawing that we're talking](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=316) [about has a number of](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=318) [children](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=321) [it has one](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=322) [lateral](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=324) [node or a friend node and it has three](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=325) [parents at the moment i have siblings](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=328) [turned off but if i turn on siblings](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=331) [then you see that there are a number of](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=334) [siblings](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=338) [and the siblings are the children of the](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=340) [parent nodes in this case i have many](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=343) [siblings because i'm displaying the tag](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=345) [category as well](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=350) [and the excalid road tag has a number of](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=352) [drawings so if i hide the tag then the](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=355) [number of siblings will decrease because](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=358) [now i'm not looking at the ex-collateral](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=361) [drawings in my documents only looking at](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=364) [the children of these objects so for](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=368) [example](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=371) [the children of this folder are the](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=372) [attachments and the video folder and the](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=374) [children of the obsidian x-coli brain](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=377) [folder are the documents that we saw](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=380) [when i started this whole](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=383) [presentation also](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=385) [looking at these relationships](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=388) [you will see that some are some of these](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=391) [nodes are blue some are white some are](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=394) [yellow you can customize the look and](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=398) [feel and i'll talk about this](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=400) [customization in just a second](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=402) [so getting back to our drawing](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=406) [the last question i want to](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=412) [touch in answering the question what is](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=415) [exclip brain is how relationships are](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=418) [derived](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=421) [and there are two types of relationships](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=422) [there are inferred relationships and](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=426) [there are explicit relationships](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=429) [explicit relationships are the easier](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=432) [ones these are specified using data view](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=434) [fields](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=439) [and inferred relationships are](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=440) [relationships there there is not a](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=443) [specific data view field explaining](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=446) [what the relationship between two nodes](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=449) [are but i'm making an assumption based](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=452) [on the way these links are placed so if](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=455) [you have a file and it has a forward](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=459) [link to another file then i consider](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=462) [the file that has the forward link to](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=466) [the other one to be the parent and the](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=468) [linked file to be the child](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=471) [if there's a backlink to a file](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=474) [then](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=478) [i infer that the document that has the](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=479) [backlink to this document](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=483) [is the parent of the document](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=486) [if i have two files that are mutually](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=490) [pointing at each other then i consider](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=494) [the relationship to be lateral and i](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=497) [treat them as friends](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=499) [and the simplest one is the siblings](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=502) [because the](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=506) [children of all the parents are my](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=508) [siblings so let's look at some of these](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=510) [on this graph](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=514) [i'm going to turn off siblings now](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=516) [and so](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=518) [you can see that today's date is a](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=521) [friend](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=524) [of](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=525) [this drawing and if i open today's daily](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=526) [notes page then you will see](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=529) [that here i have](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=532) [a data view field called working on and](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=535) [i have the link what is xcoli brain by](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=539) [placing this data view field](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=543) [i](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=545) [give additional information to a scholar](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=546) [brain to be able to figure out what that](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=549) [relationship is like](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=552) [if i go to excoli brain settings](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=554) [then you will see that my friends](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=557) [i have different fields that describe a](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=560) [friend relationship and one of those](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=563) [fields are the working on field](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=566) [if i look at](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=570) [the graph](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=572) [then you will see that in this case](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=574) [sunday is with white letters](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=578) [to me](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=582) [that](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=582) [signifies](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=583) [that it is an explicitly defined](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=585) [relationships these ones here like](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=587) [obsidian data view are inferred](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=590) [relationships and they are children the](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=593) [reason is simple](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=596) [in this case you can see](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=600) [that i have obsidian data view](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=601) [right here if i open this you can see i](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=605) [have a link to obsidian data view so i](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=607) [have a link in this document to obsidian](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=610) [data view](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=613) [and therefore](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=614) [xcoli brain infers that dataview is a](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=618) [child of this node](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=622) [and similarly i have obsidian x-coli](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=625) [brain up here which is a parent of what](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=628) [is excalibrane and if i navigate to this](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=632) [node and i look at the document itself](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=635) [you will see that this document has](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=639) [several children and one of them](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=642) [is the what is excalibrane document and](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=645) [that's how](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=649) [this relationship becomes a explicitly](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=650) [defined so the letter or the text is](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=654) [white](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=657) [as well as when i have excalibrane open](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=658) [then obsidian excolibrane is in the top](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=661) [section](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=664) [of the document](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=665) [now moving on to the second question](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=668) [how has excoli brain](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=672) [transformed the way i use obsidian](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=674) [and there are a number of different ways](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=678) [how that is happening so](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=680) [let me](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=682) [start with this topic of typifying](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=684) [relationships and i've already shared](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=687) [quite some amount about this in the](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=690) [previous couple of minutes](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=693) [the way you typify relationships is](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=695) [using data view fields and dataview](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=698) [fields are very simple to create you](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=701) [type in a couple of words at the](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=704) [beginning of a paragraph or a row in](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=707) [your document](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=710) [and you finish it with a double colon](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=711) [and that becomes a field so for example](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=715) [from](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=718) [inspired by author these are different](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=719) [fields](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=723) [and then you can see that i have](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=724) [different type of](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=726) [fields and relationships and we saw this](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=728) [in settings in a moment ago but just to](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=730) [dive a bit deeper here](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=734) [some of my parent relationships are](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=737) [based on author source inspired by from](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=740) [and](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=745) [using these different words](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=746) [help me contextualize the text the](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=748) [paragraph i write in the document so for](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=752) [example here you can see that](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=754) [latch is from information anxiety two](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=757) [it is referred to on page 69 and in](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=761) [excoli brain this is the relationship](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=765) [that you saw also a couple of minutes](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=769) [ago](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=771) [information anxiety my literature notes](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=772) [about information anxiety are on top and](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=775) [latch is on bottom and i know the type](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=779) [of relationship](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=782) [child relationships are for example](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=785) [supports or consists of](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=788) [friend or lateral relationships are](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=791) [these that similar to](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=795) [example sponsor](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=798) [date started they'd finished working on](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=800) [these are all ways to express a lateral](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=803) [relationship](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=807) [and also i have directional](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=808) [relationships so it makes a difference](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=811) [if i have two files file a and b and](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=815) [which one has the data view field and](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=818) [based on this i can create](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=821) [directed relationships so for example](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=824) [here i have obsidian excalibrane is](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=827) [inspired by the brain and breadcrumbs](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=830) [and you can see that the graph will look](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=834) [like this](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=837) [that first of all the brain and](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=838) [breadcrumbs are parents to](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=840) [exclip brain because they are the](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=843) [inspiration and you also see a direction](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=845) [of the arrow and in settings the way you](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=848) [set this up is you define](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=851) [the inspired by relationship and then](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=854) [you can select inspired by as a](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=858) [relationship from this drop down list](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=862) [and you can add your](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=865) [own customization of how that link](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=867) [should look like so moving on using](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=870) [xcoli brain has helped me to move to](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=873) [more atomic nodes](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=876) [and](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=878) [this is because if i don't have atomic](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=879) [notes](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=883) [then i end up with very cluttered views](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=884) [of the graph and that is because](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=888) [everything is linked directly to the](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=890) [document](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=893) [and the way to overcome this is to use](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=894) [embeds much more strategically this also](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=898) [means that i've started to use the node](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=902) [refactor plugin which is a great tool to](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=905) [cut a larger document into smaller parts](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=909) [and i've also applied a bit of css magic](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=913) [i'm happy to share this piece of css](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=919) [it's nothing very complex all this does](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=922) [is when i embed a document into](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=925) [a page in obsidian so for example](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=929) [like in this case this is an example i](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=932) [have a video about how i manage meetings](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=935) [and meeting notes](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=938) [you can see that in this case in this](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=940) [document it's a bit hard to see the](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=943) [darker color but bob the builder is part](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=945) [of my daily notes page but everything](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=949) [below bob](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=952) [is a transclusion and actually on bob's](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=953) [page i have another transclusion for](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=957) [project k and you can see the continuing](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=960) [content right there and the same with](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=963) [project b this is still in](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=966) [the](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=969) [core daily notes page but then](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=970) [the notes under it for my meeting that](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=973) [they are transcluded i'll put the link](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=976) [to this video](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=979) [it's called it's about time](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=981) [and you can learn more about how i](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=983) [manage](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=986) [my daily notes and these meeting notes](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=987) [what i want to show you here is as a](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=990) [result my](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=992) [ex coli brain](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=994) [layout looks much more](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=996) [simple](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=999) [don't look at the dashed lines this is](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1000) [my demo database and it's all configured](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1002) [for different tests but what i want to](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1005) [show you is that the thursday document](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1008) [has only a couple of](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1011) [links some links here i have bob the](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1014) [builder here and i have project b the](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1016) [reason](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1019) [they are inferred friends is because](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1020) [also on bob's page](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1023) [i have](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1025) [the link back to thursday as i have the](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1026) [link to bob here on the daily

personally prefer](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1039) [that in case of my daily notes all of](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1041) [the notes that i'm taking are

this i could add a](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1052) [data view field here and specify the](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1055) [relationship i can even add a data view](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1058) [field in front of a transclusion so that](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1060) [would also work and then i can move

want to](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1070) [make right here](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1073) [is i have a much less cluttered view](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1075) [because here you can see a reference to](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1078) [mock and here you can see a reference to](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1081) [project k and you can see a reference to](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1084) [rolly and project c](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1087) [so you have all these references that do](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1090) [not show on this

to](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1122) [you can see here tag wrangler which is](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1125) [an awesome obsidian plugin if you want](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1128) [to manage your tags i recommend trying](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1131) [track tag wrangler but right now what i](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1134) [want to show you is i reference

started](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1180) [to see connections between different](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1184) [parts of my vault through these](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1186)

has](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1197) [started to take over](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1199) [the](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1202) [navigation of my](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1202)

in](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1280) [reality is just a document an excludra](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1283) [document that has some](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1286) [automation and you

you might want to call it whatever](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1296) [else or place it to another location](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1299) [then you can define the different](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1304) [hierarchies and these hierarchies can be](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1306) [the parents the children and the

you want to use to](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1317) [define the type of relationship a](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1320) [certain note has to another node i have](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1323) [couple of display options by the way](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1326) [most of these display options are now](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1329) [included as buttons at the top of excle](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1333) [brain under the search bar](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1337) [you have some file paths that you

folder at the](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1346) [moment it's empty for me but i should](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1349) [probably really put here a templater](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1351) [folder](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1353) [so that](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1357) [is this is my folder for that so from](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1358) [now on xcolibrane will exclude from](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1362) [its indexing and display all my](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1366) [templates and it won't clutter my views](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1369) [and then you have all these different](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1372) [type of relationships each of these has](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1375) [a button](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1378) [you can hide virtual nodes you can hide](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1379) [folders tags](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1382) [you have couple of](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1384) [options you can also display or hide](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1386) [attachments and you don't need to come](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1388) [into settings you can actually do this](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1391) [here as a as with these buttons right](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1394) [here so it's a convenient and easy](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1397) [access](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1399) [but](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1401) [it's also available here in settings](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1402) [so there's a](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1406) [maximum number of nodes to display as](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1408) [children or friends or whatever of a](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1411) [node this is because some](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1414) [notes have](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1417) [potentially hundreds of links and then](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1418) [you end up with a very cluttered view my](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1422) [mindset is](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1425) [i'm looking for](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1426) [a simple](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1428) [easy to understand graph and](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1429) [i think that if i have more than 40](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1432) [items as children or as siblings on it](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1435) [it's not going to be useful anyway i](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1438) [need to create atomic notes i need to](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1440) [make it more structured](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1443) [but you can set this number](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1446) [to whatever you like you can go up to](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1448) [150 if you want i keep it at a fairly](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1450) [low number of 40.](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1454) [then you can do styling you can set the](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1456) [canvas color](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1459) [and you can set the style of the](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1461) [different type of nodes](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1463) [nodes get their style](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1466) [based on their type so](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1468) [you have the inferred nodes the virtual](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1471) [nodes you have the nodes in the center](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1474) [that's called](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1476) [the central node you have the siblings](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1477) [you have the attachments the folders](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1479) [those are some](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1482) [built-in type of nodes](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1484) [but also if you add categories to pages](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1486) [so for example i think you noticed](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1491) [that](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1494) [my](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1494) [ex](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1495) [draw drawings have this palette on them](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1496) [or if i come back here then you can see](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1500) [that my xcoli brain has this plugin icon](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1502) [etc you can](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1507) [define these relationships](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1509) [based on let me just let me just show](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1512) [you this document](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1515) [so in this case you can see that this is](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1516) [obsidian plugins there's the category of](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1519) [this node and](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1523) [in settings](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1525) [i have obsidian plugins](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1528) [listed here it's a comma separated list](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1531) [of the tags i want to format and i can](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1533) [choose obsidian plugins here and you can](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1537) [see well it's hard to see but you can](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1540) [see the plug there so i can define the](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1542) [prefix](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1544) [and i can define a number of other](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1546) [parameters as well the way this works is](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1549) [everything is inherited from the base](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1553) [node style](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1556) [and whatever you specify so let's look](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1559) [at](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1562) [my x color draw drawing you can see here](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1562) [i override the prefix as well as i](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1566) [override the border color and i](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1569) [overwrite the font family of the node as](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1571) [well so my excladro drawings look like](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1574) [this](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1578) [in](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1579) [the graph view](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1579) [and then moving on you can do the same](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1582) [with the link types so remember the](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1585) [links were defined up here](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1588) [the link types are your](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1591) [data view fields](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1593) [and then down here](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1595) [again i have a couple of built-in link](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1597) [types inferred folder tag link](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1600) [but then all of my different type of](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1604) [links i can define here one by one so](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1607) [let's for example](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1611) [look for the inspired by](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1613) [type and you can see](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1615) [here that the inspired by type](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1617) [is this yellow arrow and you can see](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1620) [the logic is the same you have the base](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1625) [link type and you can override the base](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1628) [link type](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1631) [using](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1632) [these toggles down here](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1633) [and then finally i just want to show you](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1636) [two more things](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1638) [if i come to this page](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1641) [and if i click this right here then](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1643) [there's a list of items before i start](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1647) [to search this is a search bar by the](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1650) [way and if i look for a document](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1652) [so if i look for for example the brain](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1656) [then i could navigate to my thought](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1659) [about the brain](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1663) [but if this field is empty then you see](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1664) [a list of items here these are the same](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1668) [as your](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1672) [oh i need to minimize this](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1675) [these are the same as your stored](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1678) [document so you can see here](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1681) [i have my favorites and this is a core](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1683) [plugin called starred and if you want a](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1686) [document to appear in that shortcut you](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1689) [can start the document like this and now](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1692) [if i open xcoli brain](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1696) [then](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1699) [yeah i need to wait i need to do a](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1700) [change here so it refreshes because](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1703) [right now the index didn't recognize](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1706) [that i've added something to start now](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1708) [it will now if i open this then you can](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1711) [see here that the brain was added and](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1714) [these are my home thoughts i can](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1718) [immediately navigate to this thought](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1720) [right here for example homemd and you](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1723) [can see the different topics i have](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1726) [listed on my map of content my home map](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1729) [of content so that's one thing i wanted](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1733) [to show you](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1735) [there's two more things i

[oops](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1752) [let me convert this](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1754) [i want to dock this](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1758) [hover editor into workspace so i've](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1761) [docked it like this so let me show you](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1764) [how the pin works](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1767) [first of all i'm going to split this](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1768) [window](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1771) [vertically](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1772) [actually i want it it to be split](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1774) [horizontally and what i want is so now](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1776) [if i navigate to a file here](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1779) [for example to splunking](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1782) [if i open this document then](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1785) [the](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1788) [graph navigates to this page as well and](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1790) [then if i navigate to something else on](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1794) [this side for example i navigate to](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1797) [unicycling then](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1799) [again the graph changes](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1802) [and if now i click on moc home then the](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1804) [view changes and some people find this a](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1808) [bit confusing because it's all of the](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1810) [different panes changing you can pin](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1813) [xcoli brain to one pane](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1816) [and the way you do it is you select this](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1819) [work pane](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1822) [and when it's selected you click](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1823) [the pin button](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1826) [and from now on](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1828) [then i'm navigating here it's always](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1830) [going to change that view and if i](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1833) [navigate to a document here](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1836) [then that is not going to change this](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1839) [view so xcolibrane is now only listening](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1841) [to this workspace right here](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1844) [and i think that can be helpful so again](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1848) [if you look at this if i navigate to my](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1850) [programming moc then you can see that it](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1853) [was opened in this pane and that is](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1857) [because of the pin button](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1860) [and the very last thing i want to show](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1862) [you is this pencil button if i press the](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1864) [pencil](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1868) [then](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1869) [the drawing is open in a new pane](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1870) [and from now on this is a drawing that i](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1873) [can edit](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1877) [and if i want i can save it with a](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1878) [different name you see it received](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1881) [automatically a name this is a snapshot](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1883) [of my graph view on the right hand side](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1887) [and this is useful if you want to create](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1890) [snapshots and you want to add some](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1894) [additional](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1896) [content around those snapshots](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1898) [so that was](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1901) [all i wanted to share with you today](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1902) [and let me just again](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1906) [convert this into a hover editor](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1909) [and make this](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1914) [full screen and let's just get back to](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1916) [what is](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1920) [ex](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1923) [call the brain](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1924) [right here so let's navigate back to](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1926) [this page](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1929) [so in today's video we talked about what](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1931) [x-coli brain is](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1933) [and what it's based on and then we also](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1935) [looked at how it has started to](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1938) [transform the way i use obsidian](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1941) [i hope you found this presentation](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1944) [helpful and i hope that this has helped](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1946) [you learn more about exculibrane](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1949) [xcolibrain right now is not yet](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1952) [available in the community plug-in store](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1955) [you need to use obsidian brat to install](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1958) [it i will link the video](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1962) [explaining to you how to do that](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1965) [in the description so if you want to](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1967) [install it it is really a couple of](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1970) [clicks it's not very hard and with](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1973) [watching that video you will be able to](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1975) [install xcoli brain for yourself](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1977) [thank you](https://youtu.be/gOkniMkDPyM?t=1981)
