# Content
Hi, in today's video I'd like to show you how I organize my YouTube channel's content in Obsidian and how I have automated my process using Obsidian Templater, the Kanban plugin, and Excalidraw. This video is going to be slightly more technical, but I wanted to show you some very powerful automation opportunities, and unfortunately, without being more technical, that is not possible. Also, in this video, I'm going to continue my exploration of different plugins that you can use in your visual thinking toolkit. Today, we are going to look at the Kanban board. In earlier videos, you might remember the map view plugin and the leaflet plugin, and I still hope to bring other videos demonstrating some other cool plugins that you can add to your visual thinking toolkit. So let's dive in. [* ](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=0)

I store my YouTube content in Obsidian such that I have a folder for each of my projects. For example, you can see that today's video is here in this folder, and in the folder, I have a couple of items: I have a video subfolder, and I exclude this from Obsidian sync because I don't want to clog up sync with the large video files, the recordings. Then I have two drawings here: one is the storyboard, which is the file that we are looking at right here, and the other is the video thumbnail. Now, if I control-click on the thumbnail, I can open it for editing and say, for example, if I want to change this cog to red, I can just simply click on the cog, change the color to red, and when I navigate back to my storyboard, you can see that my embedded image has changed. So that's the basic logic. [* ](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=62)

I organize all of my videos on a Kanban board, so let me just show you that. On this Kanban board, you will see that I have a card for each of my videos. These are the published videos; I don't have all the published videos here; some of them are archived. When I click 'archive,' let me show you. For example, here's a video that I'd like to archive. If I click here and click the archive card command, then it will disappear from the published column. I will need to open up the Kanban board in markdown view, and I will need to scroll down; at the bottom of the archived list, I'll find my video that I've just archived. So that's how you can see all my archived videos here. The reason for archiving is that it takes a bit of time to open up this board. When the board is opened, all of these drawings are created, so you can see the thumbnails here, and that takes up quite some resources. Therefore, I don't have all of my videos here under 'Published.' If I want to look at them in a list later on, I switch to the markdown view. The benefit of storing my videos here is that I can simply drag and drop these cards as my videos move through the workflow. [* ](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=132)

So how do I create one of these cards? It's quite simple. All you need to do is drag and drop the thumbnail here. Once you have the thumbnail here, if you double-click, you put an exclamation mark in front and then press enter, and this will become an image. Now, you cannot click on the image, which is why I add the storyboard as a link. The way I'm going to do it is I'm going to create a separate card for the storyboard. I'm going to double-click, simply copy the text from here, I'm going to close this, and delete the card. Then I come back here, press shift + enter, and paste my storyboard. Then I'm going to type the pipe character and then 'storyboard.' This is actually painfully slow on the Kanban board. I don't quite know what the reason is, but it is very slow, so I don't recommend doing it this way. However, I wanted to show you how you would put this together here. It's already one step faster if you do all of this in the markdown view. [* ](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=237)

Let's say I want to create the same card again; the way I do it is I press ctrl + enter to add a checklist item. Then I drag my thumbnail here, type 'br,' which is the HTML for a line break, and then I drag my storyboard here. I add the pipe character and type 'storyboard.' So I will type the alias for this and come to the beginning of the line and add an exclamation mark. If I switch back to the Kanban board, then you will see I have already three instances of the same workflow, so I'm going to delete this. This would be the manual process. Now, because this can be quite cumbersome, I created some automation to do all of this for me. Let me show you how that works. And you can initiate this automation from wherever you want on any markdown page. I'm now going to do this from my daily notes page. [* ](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=373)

If I initiate Templater, I have a template called 'YouTube Create.' When I execute this workflow, it will ask for the name of the project—the demo project for the video. That's going to be the title of my project today. When I hit enter, you will see that a storyboard for my demo project for video was created. If I open this for drawing, in the center of my storyboard, there is an embedded image, which is the thumbnail. If I control-hover this, you can see that this is an embedded image, and I can open this link, and if I want, I can start to draw my mind map here. Like this, I can click my button and start to work on my storyboard. I can also control-click on my thumbnail, and you can see that this has taken me to the thumbnail page, and here I can add something to my thumbnail like that. Now, if I open my YouTube channel mock file, you will see that I have this new project automatically added here with the link to the storyboard. This automation helps me speed up the process of creating these thumbnails and all the files for the video, and it also helps with making sure that I follow my standard approach. So I have the naming conventions and everything created. [* ](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=494)

We can also take a look here that if I scroll down, this is the demo project for the video that was created. It actually has the storyboard, the thumbnail file, and the video folder already created. What I still need to do manually is go to the sync settings and add the folder in sync settings to my exclude folder list. I'm not going to do this because I'm going to delete all of this after the video, but you get the idea. So let me show you how these templates look. I created shortcuts for us here today so we can work quicker. First, let's look at the core templater file that drives the whole process, which is the 'YouTube Create' file. It is a relatively long script, and maybe it looks intimidating at first, but it is really not a very difficult script. In the beginning, I set two constants here: one is the root folder of my YouTube channel in my vault, and the other is the name of the Kanban file that has all my videos. These are two constants that I define in the beginning, and then I prompt using the templater system to prompt for the folder name of the project. [* ](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=552)

With that, I create the folder path using the project root and adding the folder name. I first check if this folder already exists. If by some mistake I do not remember that I've created a project already for a topic, it will automatically open the storyboard for that project in case that storyboard exists. If it doesn't exist, then it's going to raise an alert telling me that the folder already exists, and it will stop execution. If the folder doesn't exist, the script will move on to first create the folder and then create the video subfolder under that. Then, I create the thumbnail file using my YouTube thumbnail template; I will show you this in a second. Finally, I add to the Kanban file. I'm opening or looking for the Kanban file first, and this Kanban path was added here in the beginning. If the Kanban file exists, then I create my card. As you could see in my demonstration, the card looks like this: it starts with a checkbox item and then with an exclamation mark, I have the thumbnail. Then, a line break follows, and I have the storyboard with an alias called 'Storyboard.' Once I have my card created, I read the Kanban board file, split it at the ideas column so I can add my new item right at the top of ideas. Then, I modify the compound file by stitching together the previous file and inserting the new card in between the parts before and after ideas. Finally, I create the video storyboard. Again, I have a template for that. [* ](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=660)

So if we look at these two templates, the YouTube storyboard and the YouTube thumbnail, those are very interesting templates. Let's first look at the YouTube thumbnail template. This is how the thumbnail template looks like. I have this rectangle here with dimensions of 1920 by 1080, and that is the HD resolution. I add this rectangle because it helps me size the thumbnail such that it will export to a well-sized PNG file that I can upload to YouTube. In the center, I have a text element that looks a bit funny, so you can see that this is actually a template or script, and it will add the folder's name here. Because the folder name is the name of the project, when the Templater runs on this page, this will be replaced with the folder name. If I look at the end result, you will see that I need to switch back to drawing mode. You will see that it was replaced with a demo project for video. The other file is very similar; if I look at my storyboard template, it is similar, but there's one specific thing here. Under the embedded files section, I have this script that will automatically update the embedded file in the template with the thumbnail file that was just created. So here I'm generating the name of the thumbnail file. There's another trick here: later on, right here, within the JSON under file id for the image element, I also have this script, and there's one more trick here. I don't want this template to open as an X-Calidraw file, so right now, this template will never open as an Excalidraw file because if Excalidraw were to load this file, it would overwrite my script. I want to ensure that this remains a static file. Therefore, I put the first triple dash starting the front matter into this templater script tag. What this does is simply print three dashes when it executes, but by doing this, I don't have a proper front matter for this document, and Excalidraw will not recognize this as an Excalidraw drawing. [* ](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=847)

How did I generate this file? This was extremely simple to generate. I created a file like this—actually not a file like this but a file like my storyboard—just a sec. So I created a file like this but without the line, and I switched over to markdown view. Then I started to do my edits. First, I added this change that I just explained a second ago. With this, I fixed this; this will never switch back to being an Excalidraw file. I replaced this part with the script that you saw a second ago. The script is very simple: it generates a 40-character-long unique ID and then adds the link to the thumbnail. That's what I would do here; I would replace this with the script and replace this with the script that you can see in the storyboard. I think this is really not that complicated, but there are a couple of tricks that, if you're aware of, will make it much easier to create such templates. [* ](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=957)

So that's about it. What I've shown you today is how I manage all my videos on the Kanban board. You could see that I use the thumbnail for each video plus the storyboard as the content for my card. This way, I can drag and drop these cards on the board. I showed you how I archive stuff and also how the structure of such a card looks like in the Kanban board view, as well as when you open it in markdown view. Then we went over the process, and I walked you through my core templater script, as well as showed you the two Excalidraw files that serve as templates in this process. Instead of the text element, you can also type in this command. In this case, I actually edited also some of the front matter of this template. The generic content you can see is that this text element is replaced with this link. So that's about it. If you want to play with this solution yourself, I'm going to upload all my templates and include the link in the video description so you can take a look at the various files and customize them to your own workflow.

I hope you found this video helpful. This was slightly more technical, but I also think that this has demonstrated some very cool opportunities to automate your workflow in Obsidian. Thank you. [* ](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=1163)

then i have two drawings here one is](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=92) [the storyboard and this is the file that](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=96) [we are looking at right here and the](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=99) [other is the video thumbnail](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=101) [now if i](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=105) [control click on the thumbnail i can](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=106) [open up the thumbnail for editing and](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=108) [say for example i want to](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=111) [change this cog to red i can just simply](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=113) [click on the cog](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=117) [change the color to red and when i](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=119) [navigate back to my storyboard and you](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=121) [can see](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=124) [that my embedded image has changed](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=125) [so that's the basic logic](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=129) [i organize all of my videos](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=132) [on a kanban board so let me just show](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=135) [you that](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=138) [and on this kanban board you will see](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=139) [that](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=142) [i have a card for each of my videos](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=143) [these are the published videos i don't](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=147) [have all the published videos here some](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=150) [of them i are hive](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=152) [and when i click our hive so let me show](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=154) [you so for example here's uh this video](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=156) [that i'd like to archive if i click here](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=160) [and click the archive card command then](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=163) [it will disappear from the published](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=168) [column](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=170) [and i will need to open up the kanban](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=171) [board in markdown view](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=174) [and i will need to](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=176) [scroll down and here at the bottom of](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=178) [the archive list i'll find my](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=182) [video that i've just archived so that's](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=185) [the way you can see all my archived](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=188) [videos here](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=190) [and the reason for archiving is you can](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=192) [already see it takes a bit of time to](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=194) [open up this board and that is because](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=197) [when the board is](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=200) [opened then all of these drawings are](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=202) [created so that you can see the](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=205) [thumbnails here and that takes up quite](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=209) [some resources and therefore i don't](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=212) [have all of my videos here under](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=215) [published if i want to look at](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=217) [them in a list later on i switch to the](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=219) [markdown view the benefit of storing

board](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=300) [i don't quite know what the reason is](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=304) [but it is](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=306) [it is very slow so i don't recommend](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=308) [doing it this way but i wanted to show](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=311) [you](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=313) [how you would put this together here](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=314) [it's already one step faster if you do](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=316) [all of this in the markdown view so](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=319) [let's say i want to create the same card](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=322) [again the way i do it is i press ctrl](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=325) [enter to add a checklist item](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=327) [then i drag my thumbnail here i then](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=330) [type](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=334) [br which is the html for a line break](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=337) [and then i drag my storyboard here and i](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=341) [add the type pipe character and](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=345) [storyboard](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=348) [so i will type the alias for this and i](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=349) [come](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=353) [to the beginning of the line and add an](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=354) [exclamation mark and then if i](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=357) [switch back to the combo board then you](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=359) [will see now i have already](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=362) [three instances of the same workflow so](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=365) [i'm going to delete this so this would](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=368) [be the manual process now](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=370) [because this can be quite cumbersome i](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=373) [created](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=376) [some automation to do all of this for me](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=377) [so let me show you how that works](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=381) [and](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=384) [you can initiate this automation from](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=385) [wherever you want](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=388) [on any markdown page i'm now going to do](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=389) [this from my](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=393) [daily notes page](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=394) [if i initiate](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=396) [templater i have a template called](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=398) [youtube create when i execute this](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=401) [workflow it will ask for the name of the](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=403) [project so](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=406) [the](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=408) [demo](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=410) [project for](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=411) [video that's going to be the title of my](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=413) [project today and when i hit enter then](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=416) [you will](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=419) [see](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=420) [that](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=421) [a storyboard for my demo project for](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=422) [video was created if i open](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=425) [this for drawing in the center of my](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=428) [storyboard](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=430) [is](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=432) [an embedded](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=433) [image which is the thumbnail so if i](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=434) [control hover this then you can see that](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=438) [this is an embedded image and i can open](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=441) [this link and if i want i can start to](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=443) [draw](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=448) [my](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=449) [mind map here](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=450) [and](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=452) [like this](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=453) [i can click my](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=455) [button and i can](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=457) [start to work on my storyboard i can](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=459) [also](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=461) [control click on my thumbnail so you can](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=462) [see that this has taken me to the](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=465) [thumbnail page](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=467) [and here i can](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=469) [add something to my thumbnail like that](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=470) [and now if i open](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=474) [here](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=477) [my](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=478) [youtube](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=479) [channel moc file then you will see that](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=480) [i have](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=483) [this new project automatically added](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=484) [here with the link to the storyboard](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=487) [and so this automation helps me a speed](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=491) [up the process of creating these](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=494) [thumbnails and all the files for the](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=497) [video and it also](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=499) [helps with making sure that i follow](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=501) [my standard approach so i have the](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=505) [naming conventions and everything](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=507) [created so we can also take a look here](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=509) [that if i scroll down this is the demo](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=512) [project for the video that was created](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=515) [and it actually has the storyboard and](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=518) [the thumbnail file plus](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=520) [the video folder already created now](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=522) [what i still need to do manually](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=525) [is i need to go to](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=528) [sync settings and i need to](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=530) [add the folder](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=533) [in sync settings to my](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=535) [exclude folder list i'm not going to do](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=538) [this because i'm going to delete](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=540) [all of this after the video but you get](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=543) [the idea so let me show you how](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=546) [these templates look like](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=549) [and i actually](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=552) [created shortcuts for us here today so](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=553) [we can work quicker](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=557) [so let's first look at the core](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=559) [templater file](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=562) [that is driving the whole process and](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=564) [that is the](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=567) [youtube create file](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=568) [it is](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=570) [a relatively](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=572) [long script and maybe it looks](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=573) [intimidating at first](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=576) [it is really not a very difficult script](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=578) [in the beginning i set two constants](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=582) [here](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=584) [one is the root folder of my youtube](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=585) [channel](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=588) [in my](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=589) [walt and the other is the name of the](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=591) [kanban file](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=594) [that has all my videos so these are two](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=596) [constants that i define in the](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=599) [beginning and then](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=602) [i prompt using the templater system](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=605) [prompt](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=608) [i prompt for the folder name](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=609) [of the project and with that](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=612) [then i i create the folder path using](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=615) [the](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=618) [project root and adding the folder name](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=619) [here i first check if this folder](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=622) [already exists](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=624) [if by some mistake i would not remember](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=627) [that i've created a](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=630) [project already for a topic it will](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=632) [automatically open the storyboard for](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=635) [that project](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=638) [in case that storyboard exists if it](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=639) [doesn't exist](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=642) [then it's going to](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=644) [raise an alert](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=646) [telling me that the folder already](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=648) [exists and it will stop execution](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=650) [if the folder doesn't exist](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=653) [the script will move on to first create](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=656) [the folder](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=659) [and then to create the video subfolder](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=660) [under that](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=664) [and then i will create](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=666) [first the thumbnail file using my](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=668) [youtube thumbnail template i'll show you](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=672) [this in a second](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=675) [and then i'm going to add to the kanban](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=678) [file so i'm](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=681) [opening or looking for the kanban file](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=683) [first and this kanban path](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=686) [was added here in the beginning](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=689) [if the kanban file exists then i create](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=692) [my card you could see in my](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=696) [demonstration that the card looks like](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=698) [this](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=700) [it starts with a checkbox item and then](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=701) [with an exclamation mark i have the](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=704) [thumbnail and then a line break and i](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=707) [have the storyboard with an](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=710) [alias](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=712) [called the storyboard](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=714) [and](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=716) [once i have my card created i read the](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=717) [kanban board file i split it at the](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=721) [ideas](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=725) [column](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=727) [so i can add](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=728) [my new item right at the top of ideas](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=730) [and then i modify the compound file](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=734) [simply stitching together the previous](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=736) [file and inserting the new card in](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=739) [between](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=742) [the parts before and after ideas](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=743) [and finally](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=746) [i create the video storyboard](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=748) [again i have a template for that so if](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=751) [we look at these two templates the](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=753) [youtube storyboard and the youtube](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=755) [thumbnail those are i think very](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=757) [interesting templates](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=759) [so let's first look at the youtube](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=761) [thumbnail template so this is how the](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=763) [thumbnail template looks like i have](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=766) [this](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=768) [rectangle here and this rectangle has a](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=769) [dimension of](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=774) [1920 by](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=776) [1080 and that is the hd](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=778) [resolution and i add this rectangle](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=781) [because it helps me size the thumbnail](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=785) [such that it will](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=789) [export to a](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=790) [well-sized png file that i can upload to](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=792) [youtube](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=795) [and in the center i have a text element](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=796) [that looks a bit funny so you can see](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=799) [that this is actually a template or](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=803) [script](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=805) [and it will](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=806) [add the](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=808) [file folder's name](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=809) [here and because the](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=811) [folder name is the name of the project](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=814) [so let me show you here the folder name](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=816) [is](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=819) [demo project for a video](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=819) [therefore when template runs on this](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=822) [page remember this is really a markdown](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=825) [file so when templater runs on this](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=828) [markdown file it will replace this with](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=831) [the folder name](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=835) [and if i](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=837) [look at the end result you will see i](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=839) [need to switch back to](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=842) [drawing mode you will see that it was](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=844) [replaced with a demo project for video](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=847) [the other file is very similar so if i](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=851) [look at my storyboard template it is](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=854) [similar there's one](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=857) [specific here](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=859) [and that is under the embedded files](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=861) [section i have this script](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=864) [that will automatically update the](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=867) [embedded file](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=870) [here](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=872) [in the template](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=874) [with the](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=876) [thumbnail file that was just](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=877) [created so here i'm generating the name](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=880) [of the thumbnail](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=882) [file and there's another trick here](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=884) [later on](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=887) [here right here so within the json under](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=891) [file id for the image element i also](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=894) [have](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=898) [this script and there's one more trick](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=899) [here](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=901) [and that trick is right up here](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=903) [i don't want this template to open as an](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=905) [excluder file so right now this template](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=909) [will never open as an x collateral file](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=912) [because if xcode raw](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=914) [were to load this file then it would](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=916) [overwrite my script so i want to make](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=920) [sure that this remains](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=922) [a static file](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=925) [and therefore](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=926) [here i put the](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=928) [first triple dash starting the front](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=930) [matter](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=933) [into this templater script tag what this](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=934) [does is simply will print three dashes](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=938) [when it executes](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=941) [but by doing this i don't have a proper](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=943) [front matter for this document and](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=946) [xcolidraw will not recognize this as an](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=949) [ex collateral drawing so how did i](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=952) [generate this file this was extremely](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=954) [simple to generate](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=957) [the way i did this was](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=959) [i](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=962) [created](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=963) [a file like this and](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=964) [actually not a file like this but a file](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=967) [like my storyboard](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=969) [just a sec](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=972) [so i created a file like this but](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=974) [without](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=976) [the line and](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=978) [i](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=980) [switched over to markdown view and then](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=981) [i started to do my edits so first of all](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=984) [i added the](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=986) [this change that i just explained a](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=990) [second ago](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=992) [like this and with this now this is](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=993) [this is fixed this will never switch](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=997) [back to being an xcollidraw file and](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=999) [then](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=1003) [i](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=1004) [replaced](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=1005) [this part right here with the script](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=1007) [that you saw a second ago so](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=1010) [here i place this script there the](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=1013) [script actually is very simple](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=1016) [it generates a 40 character long unique](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=1018) [id and then it adds the](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=1022) [the link to the thumbnail and so that's](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=1025) [what i would do here i would replace](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=1028) [this with the script and i would replace](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=1030) [this right here with the script that you](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=1034) [can see in the storyboard i think this](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=1036) [is really not that complicated but there](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=1039) [are a couple of tricks that if you're](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=1042) [aware of it will make it much easier to](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=1044) [create such](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=1048) [templates](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=1049) [so that's about it what i've showed you](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=1051) [today is](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=1053) [how](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=1055) [i manage all my videos on the kanban](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=1056) [board](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=1059) [and you could see that i use the](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=1061) [thumbnail for each video plus the](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=1063) [storyboard](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=1065) [as the](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=1066) [content for my card and this way i can](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=1068) [drag and drop these cards](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=1070) [on the board i showed you how i or hive](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=1073) [stuff and also](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=1075) [how the](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=1077) [structure of such a card looks like here](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=1078) [in](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=1082) [the kanban board view as well as](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=1083) [when you open up in markdown view how](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=1086) [this looks like](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=1089) [and](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=1091) [then we went over](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=1092) [the process and i've showed you walked](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=1094) [you through my](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=1097) [core templater script as well as showed](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=1099) [you the two](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=1102) [ex collateral files that serve as](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=1104) [templates in this process](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=1107) [in this case you can simply](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=1109) [instead of the text element you can type](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=1112) [in](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=1115) [this command also in this case i](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=1116) [actually edited](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=1119) [also some of the front matter](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=1121) [of this template as well](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=1123) [but the generic content you can see is](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=1126) [that this text element is replaced with](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=1130) [this link and so that's about it if you](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=1133) [want to play with](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=1136) [this solution yourself i'm going to](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=1138) [upload all my templates](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=1142) [and include the link in the video](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=1144) [description so you can take a look at](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=1146) [the various files here and customize it](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=1149) [to your own workflow](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=1152) [i hope you found this video helpful this](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=1155) [was slightly more technical](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=1158) [but i also think that this has](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=1161) [demonstrated](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=1163) [some very cool opportunities to automate](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=1165) [your workflow in obsidian thank you](https://youtu.be/qDSHBnl83r8?t=1168)
