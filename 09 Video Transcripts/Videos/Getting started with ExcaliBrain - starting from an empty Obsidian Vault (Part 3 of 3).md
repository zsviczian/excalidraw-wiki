# Content
Welcome to part three of the ExcaliBrain case study walkthrough. In part one, we started with a completely empty vault, set up the required plugins, and I also introduced you to the Ibis dialog mapping framework that we are implementing with ExcaliBrain. We also began to set up the basics of our graph. [* ](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=0)

In part two, we went ahead and added a bit more styling to the graph, as well as discussed synchronizing the navigation between the main document and ExcaliBrain, along with the embedded frames. Now in part three, we're going to look at some additional formatting and settings just to make you more comfortable with all of this, as well as adding some web links to our mind map or our ExcaliBrain map. With that, we are going to close the discussion here. I'm going to post the demo database in the Visual Thinking Workshop Discord space. You can find the link to that in Excalidraw. [* ](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=45)

Let me quickly show you how to find that. If I create a new Excalidraw drawing, then here in the center, you will see some links. If you click this link, this will direct you to a Discord invite, and with this link, you can join the Visual Thinking Discord server. This is a great place to ask questions about Excalibrain and engage with me and others from the community. This is where I'm going to post the demo database so you can also play with that and see all the settings I've done in the demo we are doing here right now. [* ](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=78)

Let's continue this example by first of all creating this question right here. I'm going to shift-click and create a markdown document, and I'm going to just add my question here. Like this, I’m going to click here and I've added my question. You can already see, especially if I turn this off, that this question was created with the style of a question, and of course, you will also see that two new positions were already created on the side. I'm going to switch back to the embedded mode. I think let's just come to a point where we can create one more node, do some formatting around it, and add the web link here. I'm going to create a reduced commute that reduces stress. I'm going to shift-click on this to create the markdown document. [* ](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=136)

Now I have this here, and I'm going to copy my cheat sheet over here and paste it in. What you will see is a couple of things have appeared here. First of all, this up here, the evidence, is actually a link to a chat with GPT. I have this web link pasted here as a markdown link, which starts with an alias followed by the actual link. Because it has an alias set, you will see here that this is displayed, recognizing that it's a web link. If I had not added an alias, when Excalibrain updates, I would only see the link. Therefore, it's good to add links and aliases because then it's easier to read them. [* ](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=194)

I'm going to add the alias back, and I think we have a couple of things to do. Let's get started with that. Because the evidence in my mind should be above the position, and of course, the objecting argument should be on the right-hand side and be red, as well as formatted appropriately. So let's dive into Excalibrain settings and look at the settings so you get good practice with how to do this. I'm going to scroll down here in Excalibrain. [* ](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=290)

First of all, I want to add another type—actually two other types of nodes. So I'm going to press comma and add ‘argument’ and ‘evidence.’ Now I've added these additional tags here, and once I've added them, I can start to customize them. First of all, I’m going to choose an argument. For me, the argument is represented by a scale, so I will just select a scale emoji like this. It’s an argument, similar to weighing various ideas. I'm going to add the scale emoji here and add a space. For me, that's actually sufficient. We can also add an icon for the evidence. I'm just going to simply add a document to signify that this document is the evidence. [* ](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=340)

Now let’s format the relationship, so the link style. I’m going to come down here, but when I look here, of course, I'm not going to see the link style. Why is that? You guessed it right; because I didn't add that to the ontology. So I'm going to show you a third way of adding it to the ontology. You saw in part one the context menu; in part two, we looked at the comment palette for adding items to the ontology. Now we're going to use the unassigned tags and simply copy ‘evidence,’ which should be a parent. I'm going to write a comma here and paste ‘evidence.’ You will see that from the unassigned list, ‘evidence’ already disappeared. Then I’m going to take ‘objecting argument’ and again Ctrl+C to copy this, and ‘objecting argument’ is the next relationship as well, so I’ll add this to the next trends by typing a comma and pasting it here. [* ](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=475)

Now I also have tags here because it's a document property and it was not added to the excluded list already, so I have this excluded list that I can fill with tags that I know are not related to Excalibrain, but I don't want to clutter the unassigned list. I'm going to take ‘tags’ and just simply add a comma to the end of the excluded list and paste ‘tags.’ This is a useful way of organizing your ontology because this way, all items here are in their right ontology categories. You can always check unassigned tags if you've created new ontology in your document that you haven't yet organized into various categories. If it’s actually not an ontology but some other technical field, then you can also add it to excluded. [* ](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=536)

Now let’s scroll down and do the link style settings. Here, I'm going to scroll down, and first of all, the parent relationship is evidence; we are not going to change that. So we will just recognize that we're going to look at next: the objecting argument, which I’m going to set to red, and I’ll change the width of this to 3. When I do this, you already see that the evidence is up there, and I have the objecting and supporting arguments on the right-hand side. Now, let's go ahead and first click on this ChatGPT link here. What happens is the browser opens, and I can just click here to continue my conversation with ChatGPT about this discussion. [* ](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=585)

This is something you can do in ChatGPT; you can copy a link to your conversation and add it to Excalibrain, referencing it later on. You will also see that there is another link pointing to chat.openai.com. This is interesting; if you have multiple pages from the same host, for example, while using multiple ChatGPT conversations in your Obsidian Vault, through these links, they will all come together under the same host. This was auto-generated by Excalibrain. This explicitly does not exist in the vault but is a good way to connect content from the same web pages. [* ](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=644)

There’s one more thing I want to show you regarding creating fields as you write. This is going to exemplify how it works in practice in real life. Let’s click on this supporting argument right here. When I click this, it comes to the center, but it’s not yet created. If I shift-click this, I can create the document like this. Now I have my stress and productivity note here. I want to show you something. Let's fill in the top section of this document like this. What I want to add to this node is an evidence. I could, of course, just write ‘evidence’ like this with double colons, and that’s great, but instead of doing this—and I, of course, misspelled it—so that’s exactly the point I want to show you. [* ](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=673)

Instead of this, you can also type triple double colons, and then this suggestor will come up, and I can simply type ‘evidence’ and choose it from the list. With that, evidence is created here. Now, there are also if I only want to look at parent nodes; for example, I could just type in ‘evidence’ as a parent node. So this is a good example; in this case, I could also type my double colon and then press ‘p’ and only see the parent-type relationships, then I can choose which parent-type relationship I want. Once I have this, I can add my evidence right here, so I’m just going to add ‘productivity studies’ as a document that serves as evidence to stress and productivity, and you can see that ‘productivity studies’ appeared up there. [* ](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=779)

I want to show you a few more settings just to round things up, and then with that, we are going to close part three and this series. Let me quickly show you this. I’m going to open ExcaliBrain and show you that, of course, you can turn off the ontology suggestor. Then it will not come up; there are some additional settings here. So this is how I knew I needed to press double double colon and then ‘p’ for all the directions. I have the shortcuts, and I can configure this for myself. I have this setting, and I like it so far. You didn’t see this; we’re going to do a style setting as well to make this really visible. You can add a selected field with bold, and I prefer to turn this on so instead of a field name, it adds star, star field, name, star, star, so it’s the markdown bold setting. [* ](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=845)

You can also see here that this is a pro feature that lets you create fields mid-sentence, not only at the beginning of the sentence but in the middle, where you can choose what type of bracket you want around that. But let me show you what this bold setting does. If I come back here, you can see that evidence is now not a bold word, but if I add evidence again, it will be added as a bold field. The difference in the base Obsidian style is not so strong; I like the Groovbox style. Let me show you that—you might have your own different preference—but let me just show you why I like the Groovbox style and how it formats this. [* ](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=911)

I’m going to click on appearance and search for themes. I’m just going to type in ‘Groovbox’ and install and use the theme. For now, I think this will be good. You can see here that the bold text stands out really well, as the evidence is now clearly a strong yellow and the other evidence is white. Normally, you would have lots of text in your document, so then these colors look slightly different. I like this setting to make the fields stand out. I prefer to make them bold because from the Data Views and Excalibrain perspective, it makes no difference if a field is bold or not. It is the same field. It doesn't matter if the field is all capital letters or all lowercase letters, or any mix. Evidence is the same as evidence with a capital E. So these items are indeed good. [* ](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=980)

If I have two versions of evidence, that’s not good, so you can see it right here. If within the same document, I'm using different cases, then Data View will recognize them as separate fields, and eventually, Excalibrain will get confused. But again, if you’re using the ontology suggestor, this should not really be an issue for you. [* ](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=1026)

I think that’s all I wanted to share with you in this demo. Hopefully, this walkthrough gives you a better idea of how to configure Excalibrain, create differently styled notes, and define relationships. In part two, we also looked at some settings that were in Excalidraw, not in Excalibrain. So you can get the idea that some of the features of how Excalibrain looks will derive from Excalidraw. Overall, you have a nice graph here that you can navigate and look at this argument; you can edit it right here, or if you prefer, you can have this on the side, maybe on the right-hand side. You can make it slightly smaller, zoom in, and do your editing of the document in Obsidian's normal text editor while watching the graph. As you navigate the graph, you can see how it moves as you add notes to it and watch it develop. Or you can edit right within Excalibrain. I have a whole bunch of settings here that we didn't cover. I recommend that you experiment with these settings, but I didn't want to over-complicate this demo. Instead, I wanted to show you some basic features through a real-life example; hopefully, I managed to achieve that. [* ](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=1127)

ExcaliBrain is an Obsidian.md plugin that I've built to visualize connections described in your Markdown documents, in a structured graph.
I realize that setting up ExcaliBrain can be a bit intimidating because there are a lot of settings that you need to get your head around.
This video series walks you through the process, from setting up an empty Obsidian Vault to having a fully-configured ExcaliBrain with formatted links, nodes, and an Ontology.

[this example by first of all creating](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=131) [this question right here so I'm going to](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=136) [shift click and create a markdown](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=140) [document and I'm going to just add my](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=143) [question here](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=146) [so](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=148) [like this I'm going to click here and](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=149) [I've added my question now you can](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=152) [already see especially if I turn this](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=155) [off you will see that this question was](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=160) [created with the style of a question of](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=163) [course and you will also see that the](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=167) [two new positions were already created](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=171) [on the side I'm going to switch back to](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=174) [the embedded mode and I think let's just](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=177) [come to a point where we can I'm just](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=181) [going to create a one more node we're](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=184) [going to do some formatting around it as](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=187) [well as we're going to add the web link](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=191) [here so I'm going to create a reduced](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=194) [commute reduces stress I'm going to](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=197) [shift click on this create the markdown](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=200) [document so now I have this here and I'm](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=203) [going to copy my cheat sheet of over](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=206) [here and I'm going to paste it in here](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=210) [so what you will see is suddenly a](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=213) [couple of things have appeared here so](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=217) [first of all](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=219) [this up here](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=221) [the evidence](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=224) [this is actually a link to a 10 GPT chat](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=226) [I have so this is a web link the web](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=231) [link is pasted here as a markdown link](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=234) [so this starts with an alias and it's](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=238) [followed by the actual link because it](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=242) [has an alias](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=246) [set you will see here that this is](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=247) [displayed here showing you the globe so](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=251) [it recognizes that this is a web link](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=255) [and it uses the Alias text had I not](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=257) [added an alias here so I'm going to now](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=261) [delete the Alias then you will see that](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=265) [when xcoli brain updates then I'm only](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=269) [going to see the link here so it's good](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=272) [to add links and Alias because then it's](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=276) [much easier to look at or read those](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=280) [links so I'm going to add the aliens](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=283) [back like this and I think we have a](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=286) [couple of we have a couple of things to](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=288) [do so let's get started with that](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=290) [because the evidence in my mind should](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=293) [be above the position and of course the](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=296) [objecting argument should be on the](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=301) [right hand side and should be red as](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=304) [well as arguments should be formatted as](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=306) [well so let's dive into scholarly brain](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=310) [settings and let's look at the settings](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=313) [so you get good practice with how to do](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=315) [these settings I'm going to open excoli](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=319) [Brain here and I'm going to scroll down](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=321) [so first of all](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=324) [I want to add another type actually two](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=327) [other type of nodes here so I'm going to](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=331) [press comma and I'm going to add](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=334) [argument and I'm going to add evidence](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=336) [so now I've added these additional tags](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=340) [here and once I've added them I can](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=344) [start to customize them so first of all](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=347) [I'm going to choose an argument and for](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=349) [me the argument is represented by a](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=353) [scale so I'm just going to select](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=356) [a scale like this so it's an argument so](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=360) [it's it's like you're weighing the the](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=366) [various ideas I'm going to add the scale](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=368) [Emoji here and add a space and for me](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=371) [that's actually](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=374) [sufficient and if we want we can also](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=376) [add an icon for the evidence I'm going](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=379) [to just simply add a document so this is](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=383) [going to be this document is going to be](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=386) [the evidence like this now let's also](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=389) [format the relationship so the link](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=393) [style so I'm going to come down here](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=396) [but when I look here of course I'm not](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=401) [going to see the link style why is that](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=404) [you guessed it right because I didn't](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=410) [add this to the ontology so I'm going to](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=413) [show you a third way of adding it to the](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=415) [ontology so you saw in part one the](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=419) [context menu in part two we looked at](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=422) [the comment palette for adding items to](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=425) [the ontology now we're going to use here](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=429) [the unassigned tags and we are going to](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=432) [just copy evidence which should be a](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=436) [parent so I'm going to just write a](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=440) [comma here and paste evidence you will](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=443) [see that from the unassigned list](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=446) [evidence already disappeared and then](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=449) [I'm going to take](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=453) [objecting argument I'm going to again](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=454) [Ctrl C copy this and then objecting](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=457) [argument is a next relationship as well](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=461) [so I'm going to add this to next Trends](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=465) [I'm typing a comma and pasting it here](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=468) [now I also have attacks here I have tax](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=472) [here because it's a document property](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=475) [and it was not added to the excluded](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=478) [list already so I have this excluded](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=482) [list which you can fill with tags that](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=485) [you know are not related to X color](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=490) [brain but you don't want to clutter the](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=493) [unassigned list so I'm going to take](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=495) [tags and just simply add a comma to the](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=498) [end of the excluded list and I'm going](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=502) [to paste tags this is a useful way](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=505) [of organizing your ontology because this](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=508) [way all of your items here are in their](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=512) [right ontology categories their right](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=516) [directions you can always check on a](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=519) [sign so do you have you created new](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=522) [ontology in your document that you](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=524) [haven't yet organized into the various](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=526) [categories and if it's actually not a an](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=529) [ontology but some other technical field](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=533) [then you can also add it to excluded but](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=536) [now let's scroll down here and let's do](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=540) [the link style settings so here I'm](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=544) [going to scroll down and first of all](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=547) [the parent relationship is evidence we](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=550) [are not going to change that so we just](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=555) [recognize that we're going to look at](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=557) [next is an objecting argument and I'm](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=560) [going to set the objecting argument to](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=563) [red and I'm going to change the width of](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=566) [this to 3 and when I do this you already](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=570) [see that the evidence is up there and I](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=574) [have the objecting and supporting](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=578) [arguments on the right hand side](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=581) [now let's go ahead](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=584) [and first of all let's click on this](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=587) [chair GPT link here](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=590) [what happens is the browser opens and I](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=592) [can just click here to continue my](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=596) [conversation with change GPT about this](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=598) [discussion so this is something you can](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=601) [do in chain GPT you can copy a link to](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=603) [your conversation and you can add it to](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=607) [x-color brain or X call it raw and you](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=610) [can just simply reference it later on](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=612) [you will also see that there's another](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=614) [link up here pointing to chat openai.com](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=618) [this is the host and this is interesting](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=623) [if you have multiple pages](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=626) [from the same host for example you're](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=628) [using multiple chat GPT conversations in](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=631) [your obsidian Vault than through these](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=635) [links it will all come together under](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=639) [the same host so this was Auto generated](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=642) [by x-coli brain this explicitly does not](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=644) [exist in the vault but is a good way to](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=648) [connect content from the same web pages](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=652) [now there's one more thing I want to](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=657) [show you in terms of creating Fields as](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=660) [you write so this is going to be](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=664) [how it works in practice in real life so](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=666) [let's just click here maybe on this](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=670) [supporting argument right here and when](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=673) [I click this it comes to the center but](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=677) [it's not yet created but if I shift](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=680) [click this then I can create the](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=683) [document like this so now I have my](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=686) [stress and productivity note here](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=689) [and what I want to show you is the](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=693) [following that let's just](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=697) [fill in the top section of this document](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=700) [like this and what I want to add to this](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=703) [node is an Evidence I could of course](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=707) [just write evidence like this with](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=710) [double columns and that's great but](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=713) [instead of doing this and I of course](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=716) [misspelled it so that's exactly the](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=719) [point I want to show you so](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=722) [instead of this you can also type](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=725) [triple double colon and then this](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=728) [suggestor will come up and I can just](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=732) [simply type evidence and I can choose](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=734) [evidence from the list and with that](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=738) [evidence is created here now there are](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=741) [also if I only want to look at parent](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=745) [nodes for example I could also just type](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=748) [in evidence is a parent node so this is](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=751) [a good example in this case I could also](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=754) [just type my double colon and then press](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=757) [p and with that I'm only seeing the](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=761) [parent type relationships and then I can](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=766) [choose which parent type relationship I](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=769) [want and then of course once I have this](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=773) [I can add my evidence right here so I'm](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=775) [just going to add productivity studies](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=779) [are going to be a document that's an](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=782) [Evidence to stress and productivity and](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=786) [you can see that productivity studies](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=788) [appeared up there](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=791) [so I want to show you a few more](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=793) [settings just to round things up and](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=795) [then with that we are going to close](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=798) [part three and we're going to close this](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=800) [series again but let me just show you](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=803) [this quickly so](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=806) [here I'm going to open next call your](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=808) [brain and I wanted to show you this](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=810) [first that of course you can turn off](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=813) [the ontology suggestor and then it will](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=816) [not come up there are some additional](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=819) [settings here so this is how I knew I](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=822) [need to press double double colon and](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=825) [then P for all the directions I have the](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=827) [shortcuts and you can of course](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=831) [configure this for yourself I have this](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=833) [setting and I like this setting so far](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=836) [you didn't see this and we're going to](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=839) [do a style setting as well to make this](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=841) [really visible so you can add selected](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=845) [field with bold](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=849) [and I like to turn this on so instead of](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=850) [field name it's going to add star star](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=853) [field name star star so it's the](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=857) [markdown bold setting and also you can](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=859) [see here that this is a pro](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=863) [feature if you will that you can create](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=866) [Fields mid-sentence not only at the](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=870) [beginning of the sentence but in the](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=873) [middle of the sentence and here you can](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=875) [choose what type of bracket you want](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=878) [around that](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=881) [but so let me show you what this bold](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=884) [setting does if I come back here you can](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=886) [see that evidence is now not a bold](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=890) [word but now if I add evidence again](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=894) [then it's going to be added as a bold](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=897) [field now in the base obsidian style the](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=901) [difference is not so strong I like the](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=905) [groovebox style so I'm going to show you](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=908) [that of course you might have your own](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=911) [different preference but let me just](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=913) [show you why I like the groovebox style](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=916) [and how it formats this so I'm going to](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=919) [click here on appearance and I'm going](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=922) [to](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=925) [search for themes and I'm just going to](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=926) [type in groov box](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=930) [and I'm going to install and use the](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=932) [theme I think for now this is going to](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=936) [be good](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=938) [and what you can see here is the Bold](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=942) [text](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=946) [stands out really well because evidence](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=947) [is now clearly a strong yellow and the](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=950) [other evidence is white and of course](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=954) [now these documents are artificial](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=957) [because normally you would have lots of](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=960) [text in your document so then these](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=962) [colors look slightly different but I](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=965) [like this setting to make the fields](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=969) [stand out I like to make them bold](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=972) [from data views and ex-coli brains](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=975) [perspective it makes absolutely no](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=978) [difference if a field is bold or not it](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=980) [is the same field actually also it](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=986) [doesn't make any difference if the field](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=989) [is with all capital letters or all](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=991) [lowercase letters or any mix so evidence](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=994) [is the same as evidence with a capital E](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=997) [so these items are are actually good now](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=1001) [if I have two versions of evidence](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=1005) [that's not good so and you can see it](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=1007) [right here so if within the same](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=1011) [document I'm using various cases then](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=1014) [data view will recognize them as](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=1017) [separate fields and eventually X call](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=1020) [the brain will get confused but again if](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=1024) [you're using the ontology suggestor then](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=1026) [this should not really be an issue for](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=1029) [you](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=1033) [so I think that's all I wanted to share](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=1034) [with you in this demo](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=1037) [hopefully this walkthrough gives you a](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=1040) [bit of a better idea how to configure](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=1043) [ex call your brain how to create](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=1047) [different looking notes how to define](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=1049) [relationships in part two we also looked](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=1053) [at the setting that was in X call it](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=1056) [draw not an X call it brain so you can](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=1058) [get the idea that some of the features](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=1060) [of how excalibrin looks like will come](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=1063) [from xcolate raw overall you have a](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=1066) [pretty nice graph here that you can](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=1070) [navigate and you can look at this](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=1073) [argument you can edit it right here or](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=1075) [if you prefer you can have this on the](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=1079) [side Maybe](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=1082) [on the right hand side you can make it](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=1083) [also slightly smaller and zoom in like](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=1085) [this and do your editing of the document](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=1089) [in obsidian's normal text editor and](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=1092) [just watch the graph here and as you](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=1096) [navigate the graph see how the graph](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=1099) [moves and as you add notes to the graph](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=1101) [see how it develops or you can edit](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=1104) [right Within](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=1107) [X color brain I have a whole bunch of](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=1108) [settings here that we didn't look at I](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=1111) [recommend that you experiment with that](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=1114) [but I didn't want to over complicate](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=1117) [this demo instead I wanted to show you](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=1119) [some of the basic features through a](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=1122) [real life example hopefully I managed to](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=1124) [achieve that](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=1127) [so thank you for watching enjoy](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=1129) [excaliburing and of course if you have](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=1131) [questions please use the conversation](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=1134) [below this video or come to the visual](https://youtu.be/yPJ2hTXqlXQ?t=1137) [thinking Discord Channel and share
