One thing I struggle with is converting self-help books, business books, and technical books into engaging summaries and stories that capture my imagination. I think this is super important because we think through stories; the stories that we tell others and the stories that we tell ourselves. Last week, at the workshop session of cohort 11 of the visual thinking workshop, we were engaged in storyboarding and story planning for our book-on-a-page summary of Annie Murphy Paul's book, *The Extended Mind*. Throughout last week, this kept going on in my mind. I was thinking about how I might tell the summary of *The Extended Mind* in a different way, in a new way, in an engaging way. So, what follows now is my experiment; it's a play, it's a game. I'm not sure it's useful—I'm sure that I enjoyed it. It's a legitimate summary of the book. I used all sorts of technology, actually lots of different technology tools, to make this happen. You'll find at the end of the video a slide with all the technologies I used, but I think the focus here is not on technology but on storytelling. Let me know how you would tell the story of *The Extended Mind*, and also let me know if you like this type of summary and what thoughts you have about this topic in general. This is the Visual PKM YouTube channel, and I'm Zsolt. Welcome and enjoy the show! [* ](https://youtu.be/6_kjk1YYOFM?t=0)

**The Quest for the Extended Mind**: The torches flicker against damp stone walls, casting eerie shadows across the sprawling dungeon. Somewhere deep within lies a power unlike any other—an entity both wondrous and dangerous, a force that could propel you to unimaginable heights or shatter your very essence. It is said to be a monstrous, unyielding power lurking and waiting, yet your task is not to destroy it, but to tame it—to wield its immense potential without losing yourselves in its magnitude. This adventurer's calling is a journey of transformation, but you will not face this challenge alone. You are a sorceress—wise, powerful, and inquisitive—leading a band of heroes, each representing a vital aspect of the extended mind. Together, you must unearth the secrets of how minds stretch beyond the confines of skulls, how they intertwine with bodies, spaces, and communities, and how they can harness tools and allies to overcome even the greatest of trials. The dungeon beckons; your party stands ready. And so begins the quest to master the ultimate extended power. [* ](https://youtu.be/6_kjk1YYOFM?t=108)

**Chapter One: The Night of Embodied Cognition**: The sorceress steps into the first chamber, where golden light filters through cracks in the stone. Here she encounters a stalwart knight—armored and resolute, the embodiment of physical presence. The knight bows, pledging loyalty, and reveals a powerful truth: the body is not a mere vessel but an active participant in thought itself. To understand our first challenge, the knight proclaims, you must embrace interoception—your ability to sense the whispers of your body. Your heartbeat, breath, and even the churning of your gut are clues packed with the wisdom your conscious mind has yet to uncover. The sorceress practices mindfulness, honing her awareness of these subtle signals, and soon finds decision-making sharpened. The knight smiles, knowing there is more yet to learn. In the next chamber, the knight demonstrates the mantra "motion creates emotion." As they spar and race through the dungeon passages, the sorceress feels her mind clear with each movement. Blood carries life to her brain, releasing endorphins and creativity-enhancing chemicals. Finally, the knight teaches the sorceress about gestures—talk to the hand! They gesture, but gestures prove to be more than comedic; they are tools of thought, externalizing complex ideas and illuminating solutions through the language of the body. And so, body and mind become one, and the sorceress is ready to press on. [* ](https://youtu.be/6_kjk1YYOFM?t=195)

**Chapter Two: The Rogue of Spatial Cognition**: Delving deeper, the party reaches a mazelike region dotted with traps and treasures. It is here that they meet the cunning rogue—quick-witted and resourceful. This hero embodies spatial awareness and the power of the environment. The rogue whispers, "Our surroundings are as much a part of our minds as anything within." "Let us build your fortress of thought—a mind palace." First, the rogue leads the party into the sanctuary of nature. "This," they say, gesturing to the serene landscape, "is nature's reboot button." The sorceress feels her stress melt away, her mind recharged by the harmony of the wilderness. Here, the rogue teaches that the gentle fractal beauty of nature soothes a brain overwhelmed by the city's chaos. Next, they set to building better thinking spaces. Just as a fortress must have chambers for strategy, rest, and training, so must minds be supported by environments tailored to their tasks—quiet nooks for focus, open spaces for collaboration—each room a reflection of cognitive needs. Finally, the rogue introduces the sorceress to the magical art of externalization, using tools, diagrams, and even the dungeon walls themselves as canvases for ideas. Nothing clears the fog of thought quite like seeing your ideas take shape before your eyes. With the mind palace complete, the sorceress looks to the horizon with newfound clarity. [* ](https://youtu.be/6_kjk1YYOFM?t=311)

**Chapter Three: The Sage of Social Cognition**: In the dungeon's heart, the sorceress and her companions hear the echoes of conversations past. They find a sage seated among ancient scrolls, representing the power of collective wisdom. The sage smiles, "No great challenge is conquered alone. Assemble your guild, for together we can achieve what one cannot." First, the sage teaches the sorceress the value of imitation. "It is not about copying," they explain, "but learning from those who came before. Deconstruct, adapt, improve—you stand on the shoulders of giants." Next, the sage reveals the art of argument—a sparring of ideas that sharpens the mind. "Debate," they explain, "is not conflict but collaboration—a means of uncovering truth through challenge and refinement." Together, the group practices testing their philosophies against one another. Finally, the sage unveils the ultimate tool of the guild: the collective mind. Through shared attention, transactive memory, and behavioral synchrony, the group becomes a symphony of thought. Each member brings their unique knowledge, forming an interconnected network of strength and insight. With the sage's wisdom, the sorceress feels prepared—her guild united in purpose. [* ](https://youtu.be/6_kjk1YYOFM?t=420)

**The Final Showdown: The Boss Battle with Monstrous Artificial Intelligence**: The dungeon quakes as the sorceress and her companions enter the grand chamber. Before them stands the monstrous machine—a swirling, chaotic construct of logic and power. Its luminous eyes glint with both opportunity and danger. Yet the sorceress does not fear. "We tame this power together," she declares, gripping her staff. The knight steps forward, grounding the party with their physical strength. The rogue flanks, using the environment to gain the upper hand. The sage channels the collective energy of the group, weaving their shared thoughts into a tapestry of strategy. It is not a battle of brawn but of balance. The sorceress harnesses the AI's potential while ensuring it does not consume her. She externalizes her thoughts with gestures, anchors her decisions with interceptive wisdom, and draws on the collective intelligence of her guild. Finally, with one last surge of effort, the monstrous AI is subdued—not destroyed, but transformed into an ally. Its power now extends the guild's capabilities, opening doors to realms once thought impossible. [* ](https://youtu.be/6_kjk1YYOFM?t=516)

**Epilogue: The Power of the Extended Mind**: As the party emerges from the dungeon triumphant, the sorceress reflects on the journey. She has learned that the mind is not bound by the brain, but extends into the body, the environment, and the community. Together, these allies form a toolkit for mastering even the most daunting challenges. "Our quest does not end here," she says, gazing toward the horizon. The world is vast, and there are more territories of the mind to explore. And so, the sorceress and her guild continue their adventure, ready to face new dungeons, forge new alliances, and unlock the untapped potential of the extended mind. The end—for now.
