![Connect Ideas with The Idea Compass and Visualize Connections with ExcaliBrain](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g)

# Summary
In this video, Zsolt presents the Idea Compass, a framework designed to help individuals connect their new ideas to existing thoughts by directing attention in different conceptual directions. He also demonstrates the capabilities of Excalibrain, a tool that allows for the visualization of these connections as well as new features added in the latest update. The video highlights the importance of directed thinking and introduces useful methods like the double bubble map for comparing and relating different concepts.

# Key Takeaways
- The Idea Compass allows thinkers to ask targeted questions in four directions: North (origins), South (related ideas), West (supporting ideas), and East (competing ideas).
- Excalibrain is featured as a visualization tool to graphically represent connections between ideas based on the Idea Compass framework.
- Using structured frameworks and methods like the double bubble map enhances directed thinking and can lead to deeper insights and connections between concepts.

Hey everyone, Jolt here! Last year, I attended the Linking Your Thinking conference and listened to Vicky's and Phailing Chang's presentation on the Compass of Zettelkasten. I completely forgot about it until one of the participants in cohort 4 of the Visual Thinking Workshop reminded me. I re-watched the conference recording as well as read Phailing's article about it and said, "Wow, this is not only a great idea that I can use to work with my Zettelkasten system and my notes, but it is also a perfect example to demonstrate how you can use Excalibrain to visualize your thoughts and connections between your thoughts." So, in today's video, I want to accomplish two things. First of all, I want to walk you through the Compass of Zettelkasten, show you what the idea is about and why I think it's so great. Secondly, I'm connecting this video with the release of an update to Excalibrain. I implemented a feature where you can now also place items on the right-hand side of your Excalibrain graph. I want to show you the process of how I went through reconfiguring Excalibrain, how this new feature works, and just give you an understanding of how you can use Excalibrain to visualize these connections for yourself. So, join me and I hope this is going to be insightful. [* ](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=1)

This is the video recording of Vicky's and Phailing's presentation at the Linking Your Thinking conference. I'm going to include the link in the video description, and here is my visual summary of the Idea Compass. The heart of this idea is that you look in different imaginary directions; you look North, you look South, you look West, and you look East, and you ask different types of questions. You direct your attention to different types of questions. When you look North, you seek the origins of the idea, bigger categories, or groups the idea belongs to. You're looking for whatever exists in order of magnitude higher, where it was incepted, what beliefs it supports, and what are the parent domains. You're looking up. When looking South, you're zooming in and seeking ideas that this thought in the center contributes to or domains that are children of this idea—ideas that this central idea nurtures, instances, and examples of this idea. In the West, you have similar and supporting ideas, looking for other disciplines where this same concept could be applied, or others who have expressed a similar thought that are relevant or referenced. Then to the right-hand side, you're looking for ideas that compete with the central idea. Competition can be opposition, highlighting missing elements from the central idea or its disadvantages. But competition can also mean transformation and supercharging, thus also adding items that can supercharge and transform the central idea. [* ](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=107)

So let's look at the Excalibrain view of this page and just try to show you how all this comes together. Here, I have the Idea Compass in the center, and it belongs to the category of tools for thought and algorithms of thought. I also include the Idea Compass on a double bubble map: the Wordly Map versus the Compass framework. I'm going to show you that in just a second because I think that is also a very useful tool in connection with the Idea Compass. On the left-hand side, you can see some similar ideas. Right now, this reminded me of the Wordly Map by Simon Wardley because the Wordly Map also thinks about directions in a map-like format, very similar to the Idea Compass. However, the mapping logic is different because the whole purpose is different. Also, in Sönke Ahrens' "How to Take Smart Notes," there's a quote that says the construction of oppositions is the most effective approach for generating new ideas. I thought that this is also a similar topic that touches on this. What can supercharge this idea is creating a cheat sheet. I'm going to show you the cheat sheet in a second and why I think that can supercharge this. The cheat sheet includes a list of questions that you can use as a template when you're working on a document. In this case, I have nothing below this; I have only the compass icon, but that's not because it. I mean, it is part of this image and that's why it's a subtopic of this in Excalibrain. [* ](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=248)

Now, thinking about this, I realize that there's another whole domain of ideas that are similar to this, so I want to add that idea here. Let me show you how I do that. I'm going to now open this document, the Idea Compass, because this is a drawing. I'm going to open this in markdown view mode, so I can show you this. If I were to create a new data view field that I want to add to Excalibrain, for example, I want to add target as a new field, and the target would be a South, a downward item. The way I can add this easily to the ontology to be a child note is by adding simply the target right here. Then, with the Obsidian command palette (Ctrl + P), I add this as a child. If I click on this, I'm not going to; I don’t want to add target at this time. If I would click on this, 'Add data view field to ontology as child,' then from then on, Excalibrain would recognize a target as a downward child description. [* ](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=367)

Now, if I open the Excalibrain plugin settings, then here you can see the section for the ontology. You can see the parent fields, the children fields, the left-side front fields, and this is where the new version of Excalibrain comes with more options. Now I also have the right-side friends and I also have the previous and the next friends. I'm going to show you in a second how the previous and next differ from left and right, but in a nutshell, they are both positioned on the sides. The previous is on the left, the next is on the right. Of course, if you change the words, then you can switch this around by definition, but the difference is that the right-hand side friends always remain on the right-hand side, even if they switch places, while the next friends will move to the side. Let me show you how this works. If I open the Excalibrain here, then you can see that on the right, I have the Zettelkasten cheat sheet, which supercharges the Idea Compass. If I click on this, the Idea Compass moves to the right because it is supercharged by the central constant cheat sheet, and this way, it is always a transforming or supercharging type of relationship. That’s why it will remain on the right-hand side. Similarly, if I click here on Wordly Maps, then the Idea Compass is on the left-hand side because it again reminds me of a similar type of relationship on the left-hand side. [* ](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=803)

So that’s how the right-hand side and left-hand side lateral ideas or friends work. If we look at the next and previous relationships, then that is slightly different, and let me create a couple of documents to show you how that works. So now I'm going to create a completely brand new blank document, and I'm going to create a new empty document called Page One, and I'm going to say that next is, of course, Page Two like this. I'm going to create Page Two and here I'm going to just write that next is Page Three. So that’s all I wanted to create; I don’t want to create too many unnecessary pages. If now I open Excalibrain, then you will see here this relationship, and I'm going to zoom in so you can see it better. Here in the center, I have Page Two. If I go to Page Three, then the previous page is Page Two; it is to the left. If I click on Page Two, then the previous page is Page One, to the left. The next page is Page Three, which is to the right. If I click on Page One, then the next page is Page Two, and this is in the center. This is the way next and previous work; it is a relative position compared to one page to the other. So it’s a directed relationship, while in the case of the Idea Compass, it works differently than for the left and the right items. [* ](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=943)

How did I then come up with the ontology and how did I organize it on this chart? You can see here, these green words represent my different words from my ontology. Over the last one and a half years since I created and have been using Excalibrain, every time I come across a new word or description, I add it to Excalibrain. The way that works is if I would again open this in markdown view mode, I can show you this. If I create a new data view field that I want to add to Excalibrain, for example, I want to add target, maybe as a new field, and the target would be a South, a downward item. The way I can add this easily to the ontology to be a child note is by adding simply target right here, and then with the Obsidian command palette (Ctrl + P), I add this as a child. If I click on this, I don’t want to; I don’t want to add target at this time. If I were to click on 'Add Data View Field to ontology as child', then from then on, Excalibrain would recognize target as a downward child description. [* ](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=1050)

Now, if I open the Excalibrain plugin settings, you can see the section for the ontology. You can see the parent fields, the children fields, the left side front fields. This is where the new version of Excalibrain comes with more options. I also have the right-side friends, and I have the previous and next friends. I'm going to show you how the previous and next differ from the left and right, but in a nutshell, they're both positioned on the side. The previous is on the left, and the next is on the right. Of course, if you change the words, you can switch this around by definition. But the difference is that the right-hand side friends always remain on the right-hand side, even if they switch places, while the next friends will move to the side. [* ](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=1120)

This tool is for thought and it allows you to look at the possible next steps that are connected to your thoughts. So with Excalibrain, I realized that I could create a cheat sheet for the Idea Compass and add that as a node connected to each part of the exercise and clarifying the process of using the Idea Compass. I also want to mention the importance of using a structure for organizing your inquire. The method can help to visualize how the ideas are connected and bring purpose behind your thinking. It's all about deliberate exploration rather than random brainstorming, allowing you to cultivate a rich network of connected thoughts. [* ](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=1364)

So that's all I wanted to share with you today. In summary, we looked at two things: we explored the framework of the Idea Compass, a tool for thought that helps you connect your new idea to ideas that already exist in your Obsidian vault. It works by directing your attention to North, South, West, and East and asking different questions. Then, we looked at Excalibrain as a way to visualize these connections and bring all of this alive. We talked about how you can define your ontology in Excalibrain and how you can use the Compass framework to define what is up, down, left, and right. Finally, we looked at an example of the double bubble map because, in the Idea Compass, I identified two thoughts: Wordly Maps and the Compass framework as similar ideas. So I created a double bubble map to compare the two, highlighting their similarities, differences, and how these two ideas relate to one another. As a result of this video, I hope that you are going to install Excalibrain, give the Idea Compass a try, and have fun visualizing your ideas while experimenting with Excalibrain and the Idea Compass. Thank you for watching! [* ](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=1467)

[description and here is my visual](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=117) [summary of the idea compass](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=120) [the heart of this idea is that you look](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=124) [in different imaginary directions you](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=128) [look North you look South you look West](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=131) [and you look East and you ask different](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=133) [type of questions you direct your](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=136) [attention to different type of questions](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=139) [then you look North](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=142) [then you look for the origins of the](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=144) [idea you look for

parent domains so you're](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=164) [looking up when you're looking down](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=166) [you're zooming in and you're looking for](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=169) [ideas that this thought in the center](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=172) [contributes to or domains that are](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=176) [children of this idea ideas that this](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=179) [central idea nurtures there it leads to](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=183) [instances examples of this idea or down](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=187) [south](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=191) [to the vest you have](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=192) [similar and supporting ideas so here](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=195) [you're looking for](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=198) [other disciplines they are the same](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=200) [concept could be applied you're looking](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=202) [for others who have expressed a similar](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=205) [thought that are relevant or referenced](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=209) [and then to the right hand side you are](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=213) [looking for ideas that compete with the](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=216) [central idea competition can be](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=219) [opposition so these are opposing ideas](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=222) [or highlighting things that are missing](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=225) [from the central idea or that are](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=229) [disadvantage of this but also](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=231) [competition means a transformation and](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=234) [supercharging](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=237) [so also to the right you're adding items](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=239) [that can supercharge and transform the](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=242) [central idea](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=246) [so let's look at the excali brain view](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=248) [of this page and just try to show you](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=250) [how all this comes together so here](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=254) [I have the idea compass in the center](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=257) [and](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=260) [it belongs to the category of tools for](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=262) [thoughts and algorithms of thought I](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=266) [also include the idea compass on a](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=269) [double bubble map the worldly map versus](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=273) [the compass framework I'm going to show](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=276) [you that in just a second because I](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=279) [think that is also a very useful tool in](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=280) [connection with the idea compass on the](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=283) [left hand side you can see some similar](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=287) [ideas right now this reminded me of the](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=290) [worldly map by Simon wardley because the](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=294) [worldly map also thinks about directions](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=297) [in a map like format very similar to the](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=301) [idea Compass but of course the mapping](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=305) [logic is different because the whole](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=307) [purpose is different and also in zenke](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=310) [Aarons how to take smart notes there's](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=314) [this quote that the construction of](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=317) [oppositions is the most effective](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=319) [approach for generating new ideas so I](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=322) [thought that this is also a similar](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=325) [topic that](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=327) [touches on this and then what can](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=329) [supercharge this idea is creating a](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=331) [cheat sheet I'm going to show you the](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=335) [cheat sheet in a second and why I think](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=336) [that can supercharge this the cheat](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=338) [sheet includes a list of questions that](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=341) [you can use as a template when you're](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=344) [working on a document](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=347) [and then in this case I have nothing](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=349) [below this I have only the compass icon](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=352) [but that's not because it I mean it is](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=356) [part of this image and that's why it's a](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=359) [sub topic of this in ex call it brain](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=363) [now](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=366) [thinking about this I now realize that](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=367) [there's another](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=371) [whole](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=372) [domain of ideas that are similar to this](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=374) [so I want to add that idea here let me](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=377) [show you how I do that I'm going to now](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=381) [open this document the idea Compass](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=384) [because this is a drawing I'm going to](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=388) [open this in a markdown View mode so I'm](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=390) [going to open this as markdown and here](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=394) [I'm going to add one more because as I](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=398) [was](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=400) [talking about this right now it suddenly](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=402) [occurred to me that Edward de Bono for](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=405) [example in the six thinking hats is](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=408) [talking about a similar idea so I'm](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=411) [going to add similar to or touches on a](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=414) [similar topic I'm going to use singular](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=419) [2 and this is going to be the thinking](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=422) [hats the six thinking hats and](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=425) [by doing this so what did I do here I](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=429) [typed](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=433) [double colon three times that is the](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=435) [trigger for bringing up the](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=439) [ontology suggestor in excalibrane and](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=443) [here I started to type in the keyword](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=447) [the data view field so these are here](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=451) [these names and then double columns](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=455) [these are data view fields in obsidian](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=458) [I'm using these to describe the ontology](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=462) [of the links the ontology of the links](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=465) [is simply the description of the various](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=467) [links I'm not just simply adding six](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=470) [thinking hats but I'm adding the reason](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=473) [why I think it is there so it is there](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=476) [because it is similar to this idea so](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=480) [the way it works is if I type the triple](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=484) [double Holland then I can start to](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=488) [mention for example let me choose from](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=492) [here analogous two and then as I type](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=495) [the various Fields come up if I want a](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=499) [directional item so I want maybe an idea](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=503) [down south then I can say that I'm](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=508) [looking for the children so then it's](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=511) [double colon twice and then a c and that](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=513) [is going to bring up only the children](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=518) [items so here I have for example](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=520) [examples as a Next Level detail](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=524) [of](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=528) [ideas in the idea compass](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=530) [but anyway I added similar to the six](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=533) [thinking hats if you look at ex call it](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=536) [brain then here you will see that now](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=539) [the sixth thinking hats is also here on](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=542) [the map what you can also see is here](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=546) [these small numbers indicated the number](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=549) [of items in that direction so you can](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=552) [see that some of these are more rich in](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=555) [connections than others](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=558) [now the sixth thinking hats is quite](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=561) [relevant in the sense that](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=565) [in the sixth main kick hats Edward de](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=569) [bonu defines six mindsets or six type of](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=571) [questions that you should be asking and](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=576) [he provides six colored hats to trigger](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=579) [that topic the six thinking hats can be](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=583) [used in a group setting then they're](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=586) [each participant has a hat on their hat](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=589) [and they need to ask questions in that](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=592) [domain it is very similar in this sense](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=595) [to the idea compass](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=599) [because you are doing directed thinking](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=601) [it's also interesting that now that we](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=604) [talk about Edward Bono that the Bono has](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=606) [lots of thinking tools that are](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=610) [are about this](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=615) [directed thinking so another thinking](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=617) [tool would be PMI plus minus interesting](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=620) [and the way the Bono explains these](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=624) [tools is it's not like your randomly](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=628) [looking in I in different directions so](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=631) [also in case of the idea Compass I bet](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=634) [if Edward de Bono was to explain this](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=638) [concept then he would say that don't](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=642) [think of ideas and then look for the](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=645) [place where it belongs on the compass](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=648) [but rather direct your thinking first](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=652) [think about North think about the](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=655) [origins and collect all your ideas in](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=658) [that direction and then think about](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=662) [maybe South and then West and East](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=664) [it gives you a different mindset it's](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=667) [like looking in One Direction and](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=670) [looking for items in your mind in your](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=674) [Vault that fit there it's not this](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=677) [random brainstorming and then organizing](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=680) [you can use it that way as well but](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=683) [again I just want to highlight that the](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=685) [bonus approach would be](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=688) [this directed thinking and I personally](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=691) [believed that the Bono is right it gives](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=694) [you a different mindset it is much more](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=697) [intentional and much more rigorous that](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=700) [way](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=703) [now how did how did I then come up with](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=705) [the ontology and how did I organize it](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=709) [on this chart](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=712) [so you can see here these green words](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=714) [these are my different words from my](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=717) [ontology](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=720) [over the last one half years since I've](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=722) [created and been using excola brain](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=725) [every time I come across a new word or](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=728) [description I add it to excalibrin so](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=732) [the way that works is if I would I'm](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=736) [again going to open this in markdown](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=740) [View mode so I can show you this if I](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=742) [would create a new data view field that](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=745) [I want to add to excalibrane so for](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=748) [example I'm going to add Target](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=752) [maybe as a new field and the target](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=756) [would be a South a downward item](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=759) [the way I can add this easily to the](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=763) [ontology to be a children note so a](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=766) [downward pointing item is by adding](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=769) [simply Target right here and then with](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=773) [the obsidian command palette Ctrl P add](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=775) [this as a child so here if I would click](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=779) [on this I'm not going to I don't want to](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=782) [add Target at this time if I would click](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=785) [on this add data view field to ontology](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=788) [as child then from then on EX call the](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=790) [brain would recognize a Target as a](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=794) [downward child description now](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=798) [if I open the X color brain plugin](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=803) [settings then here you can see the](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=807) [section for the ontology and you can see](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=810) [here the parent Fields the children](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=814) [Fields the left side front fields and](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=818) [this is where the new version of X call](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=821) [the brain comes with more options](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=823) [because now](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=826) [I also have the right side friends and I](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=828) [also have the previous and the next](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=832) [friends](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=834) [I'm going to show you in a second how](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=836) [the previous and next differs from left](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=838) [and right in a nutshell they are both on](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=841) [the side so the previous is on the left](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=846) [the next is on the right of course if](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=848) [you change the words then you can change](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=852) [this around by definition](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=854) [but the difference is that the right](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=857) [hand side friends always remain on the](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=861) [right hand side even if they switch](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=864) [places while the next friends will move](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=866) [to the side so let me show you how this](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=871) [works](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=873) [if I open the call it brain here then](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=874) [you can see that on the right I have the](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=877) [zettelhosting cheat sheet which is which](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=880) [supercharges the idea Compass if I click](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=883) [on this then the idea Compass moves to](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=887) [the right because it is supercharged by](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=890) [the central constant cheat sheet and](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=893) [this way it is always a transforming or](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=896) [supercharging type of relationship](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=900) [that's why it will remain on the right](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=902) [hand side similarly if I click here on](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=905) [worldly Maps then](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=909) [the idea Compass is on the left hand](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=912) [side because it again is a reminds me of](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=915) [similar type of relationship on the left](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=919) [hand side so that's how the](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=922) [right hand side and left hand side](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=925) [lateral ideas or friends of work](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=928) [if we look at the next and previous](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=932) [relationship then that is slightly](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=935) [different and let me create couple of](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=938) [documents to show you how that works so](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=941) [now I'm going to create a completely](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=944) [brand new blank document here I'm going](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=947) [to create a new empty document I'm going](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=951) [to call this page one and I'm going to](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=954) [say that](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=957) [next is of course](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=958) [page two](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=962) [like this and I'm going to create page](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=964) [two and here I'm going to just write](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=968) [that](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=971) [next is](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=972) [page stream so that's all I wanted to](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=975) [create I don't want to create too many](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=978) [unnecessary pages and if now I open](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=981) [xcali Brain](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=984) [then you will see here](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=987) [this relationship and I'm going to zoom](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=990) [in so you can see it better](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=994) [so here in the center I have page two if](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=997) [I go to page three then the previous](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=999) [page is page two it is to the left if I](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=1002) [click on page two then the previous page](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=1005) [is to the left it's page one the next](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=1009) [page is Page Three to the right if I](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=1012) [click on page one then the next page is](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=1014) [page two and this is in the center so](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=1017) [this is the way next and previous works](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=1020) [that it is a relative position compared](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=1024) [to one page to the other so it's a](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=1027) [directed relationship while the in case](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=1030) [of the idea Compass it works](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=1034) [or in case of the left and the right](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=1038) [items it works differently](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=1040) [so how did I organize my ontology to fit](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=1043) [these different categories](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=1047) [I did a very simple activity so over](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=1050) [time I collected all these different](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=1054) [data view fields in my documents](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=1057) [and I added them to deontology I wasn't](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=1061) [so deliberate I it was more feeling](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=1065) [based this is what I love about wikis](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=1067) [and](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=1070) [failings idea that this gives a good](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=1071) [structure for thinking about the](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=1076) [directions in excalibrin so I copied all](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=1078) [of these into a long text list and then](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=1081) [I started to go through this list of](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=1086) [different ontology items and I grouped](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=1090) [them into or group them under these](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=1094) [questions and once I was done I again](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=1097) [compiled the comma separated list and I](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=1100) [added it back here and with that I](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=1104) [created the ontology describing the](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=1107) [different directions](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=1111) [and in a nutshell this is the idea let](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=1113) [me](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=1117) [just finally show you around a little](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=1118) [bit of how I processed this idea right](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=1121) [here again if I open](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=1124) [like Scully brain and that as I](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=1128) [mentioned the worldly map reminds me of](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=1131) [the idea Compass sometimes it's good to](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=1134) [document for yourself what's the](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=1138) [similarity so in this case you can see](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=1140) [that I have the Wordly map versus the](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=1143) [compass framework here which is apparent](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=1147) [because it Compares two ideas for me](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=1150) [that's to the north](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=1152) [it Compares worldly maps with the idea](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=1154) [compounds if I open this this right here](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=1160) [is a double bubble map the way a double](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=1163) [bubble map works is you take two ideas](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=1166) [in this case Wordly maps and the idea](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=1170) [Compass you place them in two different](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=1173) [parts of your drawing and then in the](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=1176) [center you're adding features or](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=1180) [properties that are similar and then on](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=1182) [the side you're adding properties that](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=1185) [are different for the two so in this](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=1188) [case you can see that both the worldly](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=1191) [map and the idea com paths are a map of](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=1193) [a concept there directions matter or](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=1198) [directions count they are both innovate](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=1201) [tools for thought and they are both to](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=1205) [some extent a business analysis](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=1208) [technique a way of asking questions](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=1211) [the boardly map is used for defining](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=1214) [strategy while the idea Compass is used](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=1217) [for comparing Concepts and ideas](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=1222) [the directions being different so I](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=1226) [already explained the ideal Compass](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=1229) [where North is the source and the origin](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=1232) [South is where the idea leads to the](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=1234) [subdomain west or supporting ideas and](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=1237) [yeast are contradicting or competing](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=1240) [ideas in case of worldly map the](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=1243) [direction is slightly different because](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=1246) [North is the customer south or the](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=1249) [underpinning capabilities or services](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=1253) [West or the emerging services and East](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=1256) [or the commodity services and that's the](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=1259) [layout logic of a worldly map](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=1262) [and](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=1266) [the worldly map is actually drawn](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=1267) [visually as a map so it if there are](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=1271) [lines and directions and things matter](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=1275) [in a mapping site kind of sense the idea](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=1278) [Compass is not such a visual map now](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=1283) [with excalibrin it is visual it is more](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=1287) [of a mental model and I think this sort](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=1291) [of summary for all the connections that](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=1295) [you have on the left hand side so if you](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=1298) [have a similar two relationships like](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=1300) [you have here these two ideas that are](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=1303) [similar to one another and these are a](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=1306) [good way of representing the or](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=1310) [comparing these ideas so in this case](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=1314) [because I have this reminds me of](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=1316) [relationship creating that comparison is](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=1319) [useful after the video I'm going to](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=1323) [create my double bubble map to compare](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=1325) [the idea Compass to the six thinking](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=1327) [hats and I'm going to probably move on](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=1331) [here because here with the six thinking](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=1333) [cats so this is you can see this is an](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=1336) [import from the brain this is a pretty](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=1340) [old document in my Walt I I miss lots of](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=1342) [things so this is actually](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=1347) [an example of or an instance of a tool](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=1350) [for Thought](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=1355) [Etc so I'm going to fill out this page](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=1357) [with those details because it's just Pro](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=1360) [to the sixth thinking heads back into my](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=1364) [memory and I'm going to Now work on that](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=1368) [so that's all I wanted to share with you](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=1373) [today in summary we looked at two things](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=1375) [we looked at the framework of the idea](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=1378) [Compass which is a tool for thought that](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=1382) [helps you connect your new idea to ideas](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=1384) [that already exist in your obsidian](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=1388) [Vault it works by directing your](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=1390) [attention to North South West and East](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=1394) [and asking different questions and then](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=1397) [we looked at ex calling brain as a way](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=1401) [to visualize these connections and to](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=1404) [bring all of this alive and we talked](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=1408) [about how you can Define your ontology](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=1412) [and excolibrian how you can use the](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=1414) [compass framework to Define what's up](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=1418) [what's down what's left and what's right](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=1421) [and finally we looked at an example of](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=1424) [the double bubble map because in the](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=1428) [idea Compass I identified two thoughts](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=1431) [Wordly maps and the compass framework as](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=1434) [similar ideas so I created a double](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=1438) [bubble map to compare the two what are](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=1441) [similarities what are differences and](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=1444) [how do these two ideas relate to one](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=1447) [another](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=1451) [as a result of this video I hope that](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=1452) [you are going to install excalibrane](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=1455) [you're going to give the idea Compass a](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=1458) [try and](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=1462) [have one with excalator have fun](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=1464) [visualizing your ideas and have fun](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=1467) [experimenting with the idea compass and](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=1470) [escalate brain thank you for watching](https://youtu.be/7rnsULzez-g?t=1473)
