# Summary
In this video, the creator shares their insights from reading Thiago Forte's "Building a Second Brain," presenting a comprehensive book-on-a-page summary. They explain essential concepts such as capturing, organizing, distilling, and expressing information to create a digital repository of knowledge, guiding viewers to enhance their creativity and productivity. The video also emphasizes the importance of sharing perspectives and leveraging structured processes for effective idea generation.

# Key Takeaways
- Capture insightful information by writing it down in a digital medium to enhance future thinking.
- Organize notes based on actionability rather than categories, using the PARA method (Projects, Areas, Resources, Archives).
- Employ a progressive summarization approach to distill complex materials into useful information, making them more accessible for future use.

# Content
Hey everyone! I just finished reading Thiago Forte's book, "Building a Second Brain," and I completed my progressive summarization process, creating this book-on-a-page summary. Today, I'd like to walk you through the summary of the book. Tomorrow, and the day after, I'm going to be sharing two behind-the-scenes videos of how I created this book-on-a-page, so let's get started. Thiago kicks off the book with a quote from David Allen, where David says that your mind is for having ideas, not for holding them. From here, Thiago explains the promise of the second brain. In short, he takes us through this very simple process that everything begins with the simple act of writing things down when you find something insightful; you should write it down. Thiago advocates that you should use a digital medium for writing things down in today's world, where access to information is just simply ubiquitous. You should then package that information, so when you write it down, you should have this mindset of packaging it and sending it to your own self in the future [* ](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=0).

Thiago makes this reference to the legacy commonplace books, which were these books where people put fragments of things that they read and assembled them into new patterns. They added their own comments, and commonplace books were a sort of a portal through which educated people interacted with the world. Thiago advocates that the second brain he's talking about is the digital version of this commonplace book. Another point that Thiago makes in the beginning is that innovation does not happen by accident or chance; it happens based on a robust creative process. Yes, the general perspective of people is that creativity is this light bulb that lights up in an ingenious head, but Thiago argues that it is the result of a good structured process. He highlights some of the superpowers of a second brain, which are to make your ideas more concrete. Simply by writing your thoughts down, writing is thinking; expressing your ideas makes those ideas tangible. Once they are written down, they can be observed, rearranged, edited, and combined. By writing them down and placing them in your second brain, you will find new associations and new connections between your thoughts [* ](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=45).

He talks about the idea of incubation—a slow burn, leaving your ideas simmering—a concept that runs throughout the entire book. The idea is to think small: think in small intermediate packets and long-term projects that you divide into many small pieces. That’s how you should work on your creative projects; that’s how you should develop your thinking over time. Finally, Thiago strongly advocates the idea of sharing your unique perspective. Sharing is an important way of getting feedback; also, sharing is a key way of packaging information. When you share something with someone else, you will naturally try to condense the information, which will help your thinking as well. At the core of the book is the process that Thiago abbreviates with CODE, which stands for Capture, Organize, Distill, and Express. These are the four essential steps of a creative process and how you should be using your second brain. All of this is divided into divergent thinking—collecting information to broaden your perspective—and then convergent thinking, where you converge to an output to tell the bigger story, your story. This idea of your input to the whole process defines the capture process [* ](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=90).

We live in a world of abundance; we have access to so much information today. Our history and our genes were developed for scarcity because, in the past, it was not easy to obtain the amount of information that we have access to today. This results in a digital hoarding mentality, where you collect, collect, collect, but in the end, you have so much that you have nothing. If your second brain is like social media, which has everything in it, then it is really useless. So, you should really look at throwing things out or not capturing and only keeping a limited amount. Thiago says that you should be keeping only what resonates, focusing on actionability and relevance to the projects you’re doing. He talks about two different aspects here. He brings in Richard Feynman, a Nobel Prize-winning physicist, who had the idea of the 12 favorite problems. These were the topics that were on his mind all the time, and every time new information appeared on his radar, he tested the new idea against his favorite problems. If there was a match or an interesting link, he made a note for himself. This way, he had a filter on the world to capture the information that was important to the projects and subjects he was working on [* ](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=135).

Thiago proposes this funnel of filtering in terms of capturing what resonates, suggesting four questions: Does it inspire me? Is it something personal? Did it surprise me? If something surprises you, then that is probably widening your perspective on life and ideas. We usually look for things that reassure or reconfirm our understanding. If something is surprising, you should capture that. Is it useful? Does it look useful? If you think you can repurpose it later on, you should capture it as well. Thiago mentions that over an average of ten years, he captured about two notes per day, which is really not much. Your objective should not be to capture enormous amounts of notes; it should be to capture just one or two notes per day that resonate with you. From here, separating capture from organizing, Thiago moves on to the whole idea of organizing based on actionability. He also points out that when you're capturing stuff, you shouldn't be thinking about organizing for two reasons: one is that it adds friction to the process, so you won’t capture because you have this mental burden of where to place the information; and also, organizing should happen when you want to use the information—not during the capture [* ](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=210).

The distinction of having two separate steps—one for capturing and another for organizing—is essential. You have an inbox; you capture stuff, and then you organize. The basic logic for organizing should be based on actionability. Thiago references Twyla Tharp, an innovative dance choreographer. Her process is to start each of her projects with a box labeled with the project, in which she puts her thoughts and objectives for that project on a note at the bottom. She then throws in everything relevant that she finds for that project into that box. This box becomes the home of the project, and this is the logic that Thiago recommends for organizing our notes. We should not organize based on categories like book notes, podcast notes, lesson notes, or based on classification systems that would categorize notes by topic, such as history or biology. Instead, we should organize our notes based on actionability and projects. He describes a process called PARA, which stands for Projects, Areas, Resources, and Archives. He explains this concept using a kitchen analogy: your projects are like the pans and pots on the stove where you're cooking. Your areas are commitments that are important to you long-term, like your finances, home, family, and health; these are like your freezer close to your stove. Resources are things you might reference in the future—topics of interest or subjects you’re researching, which go into the fridge. Finally, archives are where all your completed or unfinished projects and documents go, akin to your pantry. He recommends this workflow for organizing incoming information [* ](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=315).

When there's a new piece of information that needs organizing, ask first: In which project will this be most useful? If there’s a project, place that information into the project's folder. If there are no projects, then ask: In which area will this be most useful? Find the right folder for your area. If none apply, ask: Which resource does this belong to? Where would I reuse this? Finally, if none of the above applies, place that information into the archives. This gives you a simple and action-oriented storage for all your information. Moving on to the distilled part, the question that Thiago emphasizes is: How can I make this as useful as possible for my future self? This question should linger in our minds when we create a summary or find the essence of something. The issue is this: you come across something interesting now, and you feel it’s so good and clear that you’ll never forget it. But guess what? Time will pass, and you'll find yourself scratching your head, wondering what that thought was that you wanted to remember. Instead of just hoping to remember the information, you should package it and send it to your future self, so when the time comes, you remember and understand it [* ](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=525).

In terms of packaging and finding the essence, Thiago recommends a progressive summarization approach. The benefits of progressive summarization include being able to do it in steps when you have time. Each step is a small project manageable within a limited amount of time, which you can pick up later. The idea is to start from the original full text—the book, for example. Create literature notes as you read. Then, highlight those notes and proceed to the next step, creating bold highlights, culminating in an executive summary. The "book on the page" is my version of this concept; you can see the result here. Thiago recommends stopping at whichever level is valuable to you. When highlighting, do it purposefully; don’t over-highlight. Highlight only what resonates without making yourself a complex criteria for what to highlight. It’s about balance: not having too many highlights while capturing the essence of what's truly important to you. Concerning executive summaries, he recommends writing in your own words a quick summary—a couple of bullet points about the document you have at hand—so that when you pick that up in the future, you can look through that bullet point list and remember the content [* ](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=640).

He brings up an example from Picasso's bull to illustrate how Picasso identifies the essence of the bull. He starts with a detailed drawing and adds additional details, then decomposes it into a highly simplified bull that still carries the essence of the bull. The point here is that you can only capture the essence of something after you've gone through the summarization process for yourself. The other bit Thiago mentions—though I think the Lego blocks fit better under the distilled part—is about thinking of your work and creative process like Lego building blocks. These are components you can assemble into different projects using the same blocks. Everything you express, everything you create, is a remix of your own notes, but it’s also a remix and rethinking of all the information and wisdom you've picked up from others. This whole idea of small building blocks, the power of thinking small, is a core part of Thiago's idea. He states that our most limited resource is our attention span; we must work on many things and organize our lives to focus on small bits of work that we can pick up later. You should think of your work as intermediate packets, not just focusing on the final result as a deliverable. All the different components you create towards that final deliverable should also be reusable elements [* ](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=840).

He talks about different types of components, such as distilled notes, outtakes from other projects, and ongoing items, alongside final deliverables. The difference between outtakes and final deliverables is that the final deliverable is what you produce in the end, while the outtakes are all the reusable bits and pieces. These building blocks can also be documents by others. The benefits of this approach are that it is interruption-proof. You can make progress over a longer period of time, which increases the quality of your work, as you receive more frequent feedback through sharing these building blocks. Ultimately, you can construct entire projects based on these building blocks by assembly. The more frequent sharing is a very important part of the creative process, as it helps get feedback on what you've created. This is also why working in intermediate packets is valuable. Overall, you should think of your job not in terms of tasks but in terms of building blocks. From here, Thiago discusses strategies for creative work, introducing the concept of an "archipelago of ideas." Archipelagos are sets of volcanic islands near one another, and the idea is that instead of starting with a blank sheet of paper, you should first collect building blocks—intermediate packets—from your second brain and use them as stepping stones. All you need to do is build the bridge between these stepping stones later on [* ](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=960).

The way you find these intermediate packets to reuse is by browsing, searching by tags, and using serendipity. There are two ways to amplify serendipity: one is by employing visual patterns, as we remember visual patterns far better than merely written text; the second is by sharing your ideas with others. Ultimately, the two activities of selecting ideas and arranging them into a logical flow are very distinct brain activities. By separating them—first selecting items you want to reuse and then arranging them—you can work more efficiently. Start by collecting stuff, then connect the dots to deliver your end product. The second strategy he mentions revolves around using yesterday's momentum today, referring to this concept as "Hemingway bridges." The backstory is that Hemingway always concluded his writing sessions knowing what would come next in the story. When he began the next day, he had an idea of what to work on, allowing him to continue easily. Similarly, at the end of your work session, write down ideas for the next step, current project status, any details you might forget, and your intentions for the next session. You should also consider sending an intermediate packet or a beta version of your work to trusted individuals for feedback [* ](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1185).

The third strategy Thiago recommends is dialing down the scope and shipping something small and concrete. Large projects take a long time, and if you want to create something significant, you're likely to get stuck in the process because it's simply too large. The idea is to scale down, and with the concept of having intermediate packets, you won’t lose anything. If you're not using something in your final product, you will reuse it in other means of communication, for instance, through social media or other formats. These were the three strategies Thiago recommended: stepping stones, not starting with a blank sheet, creating ideas for the next step or "cliffhangers" in your project, and finally dialing down the scope. Thiago concludes his book with the essential habits of digital organizers. He mentions three habits: the value of project checklists. The basic idea is that there’s a knowledge flywheel converting information into projects or outcomes—final deliverables. There are two natural points where your second brain connects with your projects: at the time of project kickoff when collecting information and at project completion when taking your outtakes and final deliverables—all intermediate packets have to be reused and stored correctly [* ](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1360).

For the project kickoff checklist, he suggests starting with questions like: What do I already know about this project? Who can I talk to that might provide insights? What don’t I know that I need to find out? What’s my goal or intention? Lastly, what can I read or listen to for relevant ideas? Start with this preliminary brainstorm to scope your ideas, and then check your folders and tags for relevant notes. After that, search your notes and drag all relevant notes into your project folder. I personally write everything down on a canvas since I start my projects with a mind map using Excalidraw and drop all relevant links there. Finally, once you have all of this, you can create the outline of your project and the project plan. This is the project kickoff checklist that Thiago recommends, which includes these five steps. The other habit Thiago recommends is conducting weekly and monthly reviews. The weekly review focuses on placing items from your inbox into your second brain. But while doing this, don’t attempt to do two things at once—don’t try to understand or absorb their content or summarize. The sorting of ideas requires simply picking each piece and placing it in the right location [* ](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1445).

When the time comes to use that information, you can then distill and process your notes for the project. The monthly review is slightly different; it's about reviewing your goals and taking a bird’s-eye view of your system and purpose. This is very similar to the 10,000-meter view in “Getting Things Done.” Lastly, the habit that Thiago mentions is the noticing habit—keeping your eyes open. Remember Richard Feynman with his 12 favorite problems and how he would organize incoming information to these relevant topics? Adopt this opportunistic approach to collecting information as well as organizing clutter. This is the habit instead of heavy lifting: think about slow burns and intermediate packets. Think small and think processes instead of attempting to do everything at once, which would be this heavy lift. So that is my summary of Thiago's book. It is a very rich book, and I highly recommend getting the book and reading it. I hope this summary has given you a good overview of what the book is about and that you will also create your own summary of this or another book. I found the process of creating this sketchnote summary to be quite enjoyable, and it helped me internalize Thiago's concepts and processes much more than simply reading the book and placing it on my shelf to collect dust until next time. Thank you! [* ](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1564)

idea](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=208) [of sharing your unique perspective and](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=212) [sharing is an important way of getting](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=214) [feedback but also sharing](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=218) [is an important way of packaging](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=220) [information when you share something](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=223) [with someone else you will naturally try](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=225) [to condense the information and that](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=228) [will help your thinking as well at the](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=231) [core of the book is this process thiago](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=234) [abbreviates with code and code stands](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=238) [for capture organize](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=241) [distill](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=243) [and express](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=245) [and these are the four essential steps](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=246) [of a creative process and of how you](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=249) [should be using your second brain](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=252) [and all of this](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=255) [is divided into](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=256) [in terms of your thinking and in terms](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=258) [of projects](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=260) [it's divided into a divergent part when](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=262) [you're collecting information when](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=265) [you're broadening your perspective and](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=267) [then there's an aspect of convergence](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=269) [then you're](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=273) [converging to an output to tell](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=274) [the bigger story to tell](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=278) [your story](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=280) [this idea of your input to the whole](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=282) [process so this is the capture process](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=285) [we live in a world of abundance](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=287) [information abundance today](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=290) [and](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=292) [our history our genes](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=293) [were developed for scarcity because in](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=296) [the past it was not so easy to get the](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=300) [amount of information that we have](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=303) [access to today and this results in](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=305) [this digital hoarding mentality where](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=308) [you collect collect collect but in the](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=312) [end you have so much that you have](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=315) [nothing because if your second brain is](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=317) [like social media that has everything in](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=320) [it then it's really useless so you](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=323) [should really look at throwing things](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=326) [out or not capturing and only keeping a](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=329) [limited amount and so thiago says that](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=333) [you should be keeping only what](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=336) [resonates and you should focus on](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=338) [actionability and relevance to the](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=341) [projects that you're doing](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=343) [he talks about two different](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=345) [aspects here so he brings in richard](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=348) [feynman he's a noble prize winner](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=350) [physicist](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=353) [and richard feyman had this idea of the](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=355) [12 favorite problems so these were the](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=358) [topics that were on his mind all the](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=361) [time and every time a new information](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=364) [appeared on his radar screen he always](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=367) [tested the new idea](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=371) [against his different](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=373) [favorite problems and when there was a](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=375) [match or there was an interesting link](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=377) [he made a note for himself this way he](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=379) [had this filter](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=382) [on the world to capture the information](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=384) [that was important to the projects and](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=386) [to the subjects that he was working on](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=389) [thiago proposes this funnel of filtering](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=391) [in terms of](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=395) [capturing what resonates and so he he](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=397) [suggests these four questions that you](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=399) [should ask does it inspire me is it](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=402) [something personal did it surprise me if](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=405) [something surprises you that is probably](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=408) [widening your perspective on life on](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=411) [your ideas we usually look for things](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=414) [that reassure reconfirm our](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=417) [understanding if something is surprising](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=419) [you should capture that](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=422) [and is it useful](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=423) [does it look useful that maybe i can](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=425) [repurpose it later on you should capture](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=428) [it as well](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=431) [thiago mentions this that](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=432) [over the average of a 10-year period he](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=435) [captured about two notes per day which](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=439) [is really not much so your objectives](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=441) [should be not to capture](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=444) [enormous amounts of notes your objective](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=447) [should be to capture just one or two](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=450) [notes per day that really resonate with](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=453) [you from here separating capture from](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=456) [organizing thiago moves on to this whole](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=459) [idea of organizing based on](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=462) [actionability and also thiago makes the](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=465) [point that when you're capturing stuff](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=468) [you shouldn't be thinking about](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=471) [organizing for two reasons one is](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=473) [because it adds friction to the process](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=476) [so you will not be capturing because you](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=478) [have this mental burden of where the](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=480) [heck i put this](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=482) [information but also](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=484) [organizing should happen when you want](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=487) [to use the information and not when you](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=489) [capture it so this distinction of having](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=492) [two separate steps you have an inbox you](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=495) [capture stuff and then](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=498) [you organize and the basic logic for](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=500) [organizing should be organizing for](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=503) [actionability so thiago makes this](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=506) [reference to twyla tharp in his book](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=509) [twyla is an innovative dance](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=512) [choreographer and her process is to](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=515) [start each of her projects with a box](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=518) [that she labels with the project and she](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=521) [puts in some of her thoughts and](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=524) [objectives with the project on a note at](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=526) [the bottom of that box and then she](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=528) [throws in everything that is relevant](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=531) [that she finds for that project into](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=534) [that box](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=536) [and that box becomes the home of the](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=538) [project and this is the logic that](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=540) [thiago recommends how we should organize](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=543) [our notes we should not organize](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=546) [based on category of notes like book](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=548) [notes podcast notes lesson notes or we](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=551) [should not organize based on some](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=554) [classification system that would give a](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=556) [type to your your notes like notes on](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=560) [history biology etc but you should](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=563) [organize your notes based on](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=565) [actionability based on projects](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=568) [he describes this process called pera](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=571) [which is this process of organizing all](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=575) [your information and para stands for](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=578) [projects areas resources and archives](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=582) [and he explains this concept using a](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=585) [kitchen where he says that your projects](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=588) [are like your pans and pots on the stove](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=591) [where you're cooking and your areas](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=594) [these are the things that you're](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=597) [committed to on the long term that are](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=598) [important to you like your finances your](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=601) [home your family your health](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=603) [they are like your freezer close to your](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=605) [stove and then you have your resources](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=609) [these are things that you might want to](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=612) [reference in the future](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=613) [these are topics that you're interested](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=615) [in or subjects you're researching](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=618) [potentially and these go into the fridge](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=620) [and then finally you have your archives](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=624) [and this is where all your completed or](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=626) [unholed](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=629) [projects and documents go and this is](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=630) [like your pantry and he recommends this](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=634) [workflow to organize incoming](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=637) [information and he says that when](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=640) [there's a new piece of information and](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=642) [you need to organize it you should ask](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=644) [first](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=646) [in which project will this be most](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=648) [useful and if you if there's a project](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=649) [you should place that piece of](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=651) [information to the projects folder](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=653) [if there are no projects then the](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=656) [question is in which area will this be](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=658) [most useful and then you should find the](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=660) [right folder for your area](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=662) [if there are none then the question is](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=666) [which resource does this belong to where](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=669) [would i reuse this and finally if all of](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=671) [the above](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=675) [don't work then you place that](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=676) [information into the archives and with](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=678) [this you get a very](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=681) [simple and action oriented storage for](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=683) [all your information](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=687) [moving on to the distilled part the](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=690) [question that thiago](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=693) [asked is](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=695) [how can i make this as useful as](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=696) [possible for my future self that is the](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=699) [question that should be in the back of](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=702) [our mind when we are creating](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=704) [a summary when we are distilling](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=707) [something finding its essence the issue](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=709) [is this](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=712) [you come across something interesting](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=713) [now and you feel that this is so](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=716) [interesting](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=719) [so good you have such a clear](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=720) [understanding of this that for sure](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=723) [you're never going to forget this but](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=727) [guess what time will pass and in the](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=728) [future you'll find yourself scratching](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=732) [your head what was that thought that i](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=734) [wanted to remember](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=736) [and therefore instead of just hoping](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=739) [that you will remember the information](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=742) [you should package it](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=744) [and then send it to your future self so](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=747) [when the time comes you remember and you](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=749) [understand and in terms of packaging and](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=752) [finding the essence thiago recommends](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=755) [this progressive summarization approach](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=758) [and the benefits of progressive](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=761) [summarization is that you can do it in](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=763) [steps when you have time and each of](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=766) [these steps are](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=768) [small individual projects that you can](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=770) [do in a limited amount of time and then](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=772) [pick up later and the idea is you start](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=775) [from your original full text the book](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=779) [for example you create literature notes](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=782) [as you read](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=785) [the book then you highlight those notes](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=786) [and you can go to the next step and](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=789) [create bold highlights and you close](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=791) [with an executive summary the item the](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=794) [book on the page is my edition you can](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=797) [see the result here thiago recommends](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=799) [that you stop at whichever level is](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=802) [valuable to you](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=805) [when looking at highlighting you should](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=807) [not over highlight you should always](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=809) [highlight with the purpose so don't just](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=812) [highlight everything that is in the book](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=814) [but](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=817) [just highlight what resonates and don't](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=817) [make yourself a complex criteria of what](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=820) [you're highlighting](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=823) [but keep this in balance in terms of not](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=825) [having too many highlights and at the](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=827) [same time highlighting the essence](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=830) [highlighting what's really important to](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=832) [you](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=835) [and in terms of executive summary](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=835) [he recommends writing with your own](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=838) [words a quick summary of couple of](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=841) [bullet points about the piece of](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=843) [document that you have at hand so in the](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=846) [future when you pick that up you can](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=849) [look through that bullet point](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=851) [list and that is going to](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=853) [remind you of the content and he brings](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=856) [this example from picasso](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=859) [picasso's bull and what this](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=861) [demonstrates is how](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=864) [picasso](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=866) [identifies the essence of the bull he](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=867) [starts with the drawing of a bull he](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=870) [then adds additional detail to that bull](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=873) [and then he starts to](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=877) [decompose it and comes to this very last](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=879) [step](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=882) [of this highly simplified bull that](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=883) [still](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=886) [carries the essence of the ball and the](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=887) [point here is](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=890) [you can only capture the essence of](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=892) [something then you went through the](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=895) [summarization process](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=896) [for yourself the other bit that thiago](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=899) [mentions and i put this all](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=902) [under the express part though i think](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=905) [the lego blocks fit a bit better to the](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=907) [distilled part but it is on](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=910) [the border line so what tiago mentions](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=912) [is you should think of your](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=915) [work and of your creative process of](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=918) [your notes in this mindset of lego](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=921) [blocks](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=924) [building blocks that you can use to](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=925) [assemble different projects with the](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=927) [same blocks everything that you express](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=930) [everything that you make is really a](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=934) [remix it's a remix of your own notes but](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=936) [it's also a remix](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=940) [and a re-thinking of all the information](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=942) [all the knowledge and wisdom that you've](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=946) [picked up from others this whole idea of](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=948) [small building blocks this power of](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=951) [thinking small is a core part of](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=954) [thiago's idea so he says that](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=956) [our most limited resource is our](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=960) [attention span our attention we have to](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=963) [work on many things and we need to](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=966) [somehow organize our life that we can](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=968) [focus on a small bit of work and then we](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=971) [can pick it up later](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=975) [and you should think of your](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=977) [work as intermediate packets so it's not](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=979) [only the end result](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=982) [that's a piece of deliverable but all](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=984) [your different parts that you create as](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=987) [you work towards your final deliverable](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=990) [are also](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=993) [reusable components they should be](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=994) [reusable pieces of material he talks](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=996) [about different types of components like](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=999) [your distilled notes](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1002) [out takes from other projects working](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1004) [progress items some of your](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1008) [final deliverables so the difference](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1011) [between outtakes and final deliverables](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1014) [is the final deliverable is what you](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1016) [produced in the end the outtakes are all](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1018) [the reusable bits and pieces and of](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1021) [course these building blocks can be](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1024) [documents by others](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1026) [the benefits of this approach is that](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1029) [this is interruption proof](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1031) [that](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1033) [you can make progress over a longer](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1034) [period of time](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1037) [this increases the quality of your work](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1038) [because you can get more frequent](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1041) [feedback by more frequent sharing of](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1043) [building blocks and you can build entire](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1046) [projects in the end](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1049) [based on these building blocks just by](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1051) [assembly](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1054) [and as i mentioned here in the more](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1055) [frequent sharing](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1058) [that is indeed a very important part of](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1059) [the creative process to](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1062) [share and get feedback on what you've](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1065) [created and this is also why working in](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1068) [intermediate packets is valuable](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1071) [overall you should think of your job not](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1074) [in terms of tasks but in terms of](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1078) [building blocks and from here](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1081) [thiago moves on to talk about some](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1083) [strategies for creative work and he](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1086) [talks about the archipelago of ideas](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1089) [archipelago are volcanic islands next to](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1092) [one another and here the](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1095) [idea is that instead of starting with a](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1097) [blank sheet of paper you should first](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1101) [collect](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1103) [building blocks intermediate packets](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1104) [from your second brain and use them as](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1107) [stepping stones and](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1111) [all you need to do is to build the](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1114) [bridge between these stepping stones](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1116) [later on and the way you find these](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1118) [intermediate packets that you can reuse](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1121) [is you browse you search search by tags](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1124) [as well as you use serendipity and there](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1128) [are two ways to amplify serendipity one](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1131) [is by using visual patterns we remember](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1134) [visual patterns much better than just](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1137) [written text](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1140) [and second by sharing your ideas with](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1141) [others](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1144) [the bottom line is the two activities of](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1145) [choosing ideas and arranging ideas into](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1148) [a logical flow](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1151) [are two very different brain activities](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1153) [and separating these two](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1156) [first selecting items that you want to](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1158) [reuse](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1161) [and then arranging them](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1162) [finding the bridges between your](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1164) [stepping stones](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1167) [if you](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1168) [separate your work like this that is](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1169) [going to help you be more efficient you](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1171) [start with collecting stuff and then you](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1175) [connect the dots and that's how you](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1178) [deliver your end product](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1180) [the second strategy](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1183) [he mentions is using yesterday's](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1185) [momentum today and he refers to this as](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1188) [hemingway bridges the back story is that](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1191) [hemingway always ended his writing](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1194) [sessions when he knew what was going to](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1197) [come next in the story so](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1200) [next day when he sat down he already had](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1203) [an idea of what to work on and he](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1206) [finished again with the next step and](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1208) [this helped his creative process and](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1211) [similarly at the end of every work](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1214) [session you should write down the ideas](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1217) [for the next step](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1220) [the current status of your projects any](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1222) [details that you might forget](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1225) [your intention for the next session and](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1228) [potentially you should also send an](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1232) [intermediate packet a beta version of](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1235) [your work to some people you trust to](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1238) [gain feedback](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1240) [and the third strategy thiago recommends](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1243) [is dialing down the scope shipping](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1246) [something small and concrete](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1249) [large projects take long time and if you](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1252) [want to create something large you're](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1255) [probably going to get stuck in the](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1257) [process because it's simply too large](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1259) [the idea is to scale down and with this](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1262) [whole concept of having](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1265) [intermediate packets you don't have the](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1268) [issue of losing stuff because if you're](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1270) [not using something in your final](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1273) [product you will reuse it in other means](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1276) [of communication for example you can](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1279) [reuse intermediate packets in social](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1282) [media or you can reuse it](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1285) [in other ways as well so these were the](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1287) [three strategies that thiago recommended](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1290) [the stepping stones and not starting](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1294) [with a blank sheet creating the](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1297) [ideas for the next step or these](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1300) [cliffhangers if you will in your project](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1303) [and finally dialing down thiago finishes](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1306) [his book with](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1310) [the essential habit of digital](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1311) [organizers and he mentions three habits](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1314) [he mentions the](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1317) [value of project checklist so](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1320) [the basic idea here is that](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1323) [there's this knowledge flywheel that](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1326) [converts information into](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1329) [projects or](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1332) [outcomes final deliverables and there](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1334) [are two natural points where your](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1337) [second brain connects with your projects](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1342) [and that is at the time of project](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1345) [kickoff](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1347) [when you're collecting information and](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1348) [it's at the time of project completion](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1350) [when you're taking your outtakes and](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1353) [final deliverables all the intermediate](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1355) [packets that can be reused and you store](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1357) [them in the right place](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1360) [and so thiago recommends to create this](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1362) [project kickoff and project completion](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1365) [checklist and on the project kickoff](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1367) [checklist he suggests to start with](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1369) [these questions of what do i already](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1372) [know about this project](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1374) [who can i talk to who might provide me](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1377) [some insights](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1379) [what don't i know that i need to find](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1381) [out what is my goal or intention and](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1383) [what can i read or listen to for](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1388) [relevant ideas so](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1390) [start with this sort of](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1392) [initial brainstorm to scope your ideas](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1394) [and then move on to check your folders](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1397) [and tags for relevant notes](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1400) [then search your notes and then](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1403) [drag all of your notes onto your folder](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1406) [for the project i write here onto the](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1409) [canvas because i start my projects](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1412) [with a mind map an ex-collider mind map](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1415) [and i drop all the relevant links on](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1418) [there](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1420) [and finally when you have all of this](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1421) [then you can create the outline of your](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1424) [project as well as create your project](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1427) [plan so this is the project kickoff](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1429) [checklist that thiago recommends with](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1432) [these five steps](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1435) [the other habit that thiago recommends](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1437) [is having](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1440) [weekly and monthly reviews the weekly](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1441) [review is about placing items from your](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1444) [inbox](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1448) [into your second brain but when you do](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1449) [this don't try to do two things at the](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1452) [same time so don't try to understand or](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1454) [absorb their contents don't try to](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1457) [summarize or highlight the sorting of](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1459) [ideas is about just simply picking up](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1462) [each piece and placing them in the right](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1465) [place and then](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1467) [when the time comes and when you need](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1470) [the information then you can do the](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1472) [distilling and then you can do the](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1475) [project processing of these notes](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1478) [the monthly review is slightly different](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1481) [it's about reviewing your goals](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1484) [reviewing taking a bird's-eye view on](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1486) [your system and on your purpose it is](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1489) [very similar to](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1492) [the 10 000 meter view in getting things](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1494) [done](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1498) [and then finally](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1499) [the habit that thiago mentions is this](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1501) [noticing habit](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1504) [when you keep your eyes open so remember](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1506) [richard feyman with his 12 favorite](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1508) [questions and how he organizes the](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1511) [incoming information to one of these](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1514) [relevant topics](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1517) [take this opportunistic approach to](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1519) [collecting information as well as to](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1522) [organizing clutter this is the habit](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1525) [instead of the heavy lifts so think](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1529) [about slow burns think about](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1532) [intermediate packets think about think](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1535) [small and think process instead of](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1538) [trying to do everything at the same time](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1541) [which would be this heavy lift](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1544) [so that is my summary of thiago's book](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1547) [it is a very rich book](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1551) [i highly recommend getting the book and](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1554) [reading it i hope](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1556) [that this summary gave you a good](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1558) [overview of what the book is about](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1561) [and that you will also create your own](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1564) [summary of either this book or some](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1567) [other book i really found the process of](https://youtu.be/3i4CiImIYYA?t=1569)
