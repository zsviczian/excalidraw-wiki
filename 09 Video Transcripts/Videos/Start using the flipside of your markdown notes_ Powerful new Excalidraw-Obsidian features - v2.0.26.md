Oh my god, there are just so many things I need to show you! This update is a very big deal, but on top of all that, this is also going to be a bit of an unusual walkthrough. Hi, I'm Nicole Vanderen. Yes, I'm Vian. We are in a hotel in Utah, just after the PKM Summit 2024. I'll organize the walk-around snippets from my chat with Jolt on Hoven. We met at the summit last week and have just spent two days with each other and, I don't know, around 150-160 amazing people; it was just plain amazing. If you're not familiar with my channel, the video is about the Excalidraw plugin that I'm developing for Obsidian MD; links are in the description. There's a lot to cover today; we'll talk about improvements to the interactive embeds developments that make it easier to flip the page over, some Easter egg features—the seasonal pun is intended—a minor but important file format change, a new image annotation feature similar to cropping, support for multiple Excalidraw templates, and the referencing parts of images using the frame titles. [* ](https://youtu.be/tHUcD4rWIuY?t=0)

Let’s get started! One of the things that has stopped me from fully getting into visual thinking and visual PKM is that I felt like I had to choose between building something that's completely visual or something that's completely text. If I have to choose between the two of them, I'm going to choose text because it's easier to search and it's easier to create stuff; you know, to type things rather than to draw things, at least for me. But what Jolt is talking about is this really cool concept of having it both because now Excalidraw files, Excalidraw drawings in Obsidian, can be saved as Markdown. And if they're Markdown, then really it can just be the same note—one note with two different modes. I'm going to implement a feature to convert your existing Markdown notes into Excalidraw notes. [* ](https://youtu.be/tHUcD4rWIuY?t=45)

Yeah, that will give you the freedom that even if you started with a Markdown note and think, "Okay, I should actually add a drawing on the other side," then that's going to be easy to do. Like Nicole, I'm also very excited about the idea of flipping the sheet over to support this. Now, you can flip any Markdown document over with a new command palette action that adds the necessary Excalidraw markup to any existing note in your vault. Simply open an existing Markdown document, access the Obsidian command palette with Control or Command + P, and pick "Convert Markdown note to Excalidraw drawing." You can switch back to Markdown view mode by selecting "Toggle between Excalidraw and Markdown mode" in the command palette. [* ](https://youtu.be/tHUcD4rWIuY?t=90)

I was saying to Jolt once he told me this idea, I was like, "Why wouldn't I have every note be an Excalidraw drawing and a Markdown note? Why would I limit myself even if it's something that I don't really—I can't visualize it. I mean, it doesn't hurt to have the option, and if the option were there and it's easy to switch to it, then I might be more likely to visualize something on that other side." It's like flipping the sheet over when I didn't know I could do that. In another discussion, Nicole went as far as suggesting to mass convert all her notes to Excalidraw files. This is possible since the minimum Excalidraw markup is really light; however, I advise against this and recommend going one step at a time. But let’s imagine this scenario for a moment—all your files are Excalidraw files; you will likely face two issues, both of which are addressed in the new release. [* ](https://youtu.be/tHUcD4rWIuY?t=136)

First, sometimes you want your note to open in Markdown by default, not as a drawing. The Excalidraw open MD document property does just that! Simply add `excalidraw_open_md: true` to the front matter, and when you click on an Excalidraw file, it will open in Markdown by default. Second, if you publish your notes with Obsidian Publish, and all your notes are Excalidraw files, you will likely want to hide the Excalidraw markup in your published pages. This takes us to the Easter egg feature: simply add the opening Markdown command symbol, the double percentage sign, to the line right above text elements. The next time you open and save the Excalidraw drawing, Excalidraw will automatically remove the other command symbols below text elements, ensuring that the entire section is hidden on the web. Just as a side note, you can force-save your drawing in Excalidraw view mode by pressing Control + S—note that it is Control + S on both Mac and Windows. You will also find the force-save button in the Obsidian tools panel. [* ](https://youtu.be/tHUcD4rWIuY?t=204)

This change, which allows you to hide the Excalidraw markup, also comes with a minor file format change that makes the Excalidraw Markdown easier to read and edit manually. There is now a new section in the file format called "element links," but watch out! This impacts backward compatibility. Files you save with version 2.26 will not fully work with earlier versions. Thus, I advise updating Excalidraw on all your devices. But how would you use the visual side of the note? On the visual side, you can create a small visual; you should really think of it as a Post-It note. You have a small visual, and then behind it, you can have a large amount of text, links, and ideas. If you summarize the note on the other side with a small visual, it gives you another level of how you can engage with your concepts, because when you start to organize your concepts, you're organizing these visual cards, and you're creating connections between those cards. Yes, on the other side, you have the detail, but it's sort of a visual summary of your card, which adds another dimension and also helps you remember the content better. I think it's just such a good idea. [* ](https://youtu.be/tHUcD4rWIuY?t=267)

If you want to learn more about this, I recommend watching my video about the forcing function; the link is in the description. But what if you find switching between Markdown and Excalidraw cumbersome? I have two solutions for this. Remember how I used the command palette to flip the page? You can configure a key combination to flip the page open in Obsidian hotkey settings and look for "Toggle between Excalidraw and Markdown mode." As a side note, it was fun to learn at the summit that Nicole has set up exactly the same shortcut: Control + Alt + E or Command + Option on my Mac, to switch between Markdown view and Excalidraw view. Plus, there is a huge improvement to Markdown embeds. The plugin now supports embedding sections from the backside of a drawing, including something similar to how cards function on the Obsidian canvas. So, if you're like Nicole and can't choose, you can now have it both ways at the same time! You can have the back of the card on the front and the front of the card on the back. Let me show you. By right-clicking and selecting “Add back of note card” from the context menu or the command palette, you can create Markdown embeds that reference sections on the backside of the drawing that you're currently editing. Notice how, when I flip this page over to Markdown view mode, the new heading is there in the document. A similar feature is also available to insert any file, allowing you to add a Markdown section from another Excalidraw file. Additionally, I have implemented a few minor quality of life changes. For example, if an embeddable element is selected in the scene, pressing the enter button will jump right into editing mode. I also fixed a number of small bugs with the embedded element style settings. Remember how I said you can have the back on the front and the front on the back? If you're in Markdown mode, you can insert the front of the card as an image reference. If you auto-export drawings to SVG, this will make your notes publish-ready. [* ](https://youtu.be/tHUcD4rWIuY?t=387)

But if you're still not convinced, here's Nicole talking about how she uses visuals in her own workflow. I think where I go to visual things is when I'm trying to understand really abstract concepts. I also do it from the point of view of people. I do it a lot to visualize teams like, "This person is within this team." So, there's not necessarily a hierarchy, but I like to group people like, "These people are in this team and these people are in this other team." It helps me see, like, "Oh, that’s why they know each other," or whatever. So finally, there are three additional features I want to show you very briefly. First, I implemented a new image annotation function that works very similarly to image cropping. Pick any image on Obsidian Canvas or in a Markdown note and select "Annotate image in Excalidraw" from the command palette. This will embed the image into Excalidraw, where you can annotate it and replace the image in the original location with the Excalidraw version. The feature comes with settings similar to cropping. I recommend watching the cropping video to get a good understanding. [* ](https://youtu.be/tHUcD4rWIuY?t=430)

Second, this is a feature I wanted to implement for so long: you can now reference frames by their names. This is great when you're creating a presentation in Excalidraw and want to author a Markdown note that accompanies your presentation or simply want to print the slides. Finally, though this was already released two weeks ago, I thought I'd mention the support for multiple templates. Simply set a folder as your template in plug-in settings, and files in that folder will be treated as different templates. For example, I have a template with normal fonts—not the hand-drawn fonts—for illustrations I create at work, because normal fonts are easier to read when presented. I have a second template with a very small export padding that I use when deconstructing images. Finally, I have the base template I use for most of my drawings. Multiple templates open so many opportunities! [* ](https://youtu.be/tHUcD4rWIuY?t=494)

And stay tuned for the next video! Yeah, absolutely! So, Nicole, this was awesome! I’m just super happy that we had this summit that we both came to and met and, of course, met with lots of other great people that we either knew from various social media channels and through YouTube, etc. So, it was just an amazing opportunity, and I’m looking forward to next year! [* ](https://youtu.be/tHUcD4rWIuY?t=765) Next year and the next opportunity, yes, absolutely! Yeah, and there is going to be a PKM Summit in Europe next year. I don’t exactly remember the date—mid-March next year—and then also in the US, and that will be in April. We will link in the description to the site that you can go to for PKM Summit so you can be informed, because you know the dates might change or something. But highly recommend it! I’m glad that we both went, yes, and finally met each other and met some of you as well. Maybe next time we’ll meet more of you! Absolutely! Alright, thank you, and thank you!

convinced](https://youtu.be/tHUcD4rWIuY?t=611) [here's Nicole talking about how she uses](https://youtu.be/tHUcD4rWIuY?t=614) [visuals in her own](https://youtu.be/tHUcD4rWIuY?t=617) [workflow I think where I go to visual](https://youtu.be/tHUcD4rWIuY?t=619) [things is when I'm trying to understand](https://youtu.be/tHUcD4rWIuY?t=622) [really abstract Concepts I also do it it](https://youtu.be/tHUcD4rWIuY?t=625) [from the point of view of people I do it](https://youtu.be/tHUcD4rWIuY?t=629) [a lot to visualize teams like this](https://youtu.be/tHUcD4rWIuY?t=632) [person is within this team so there's](https://youtu.be/tHUcD4rWIuY?t=634) [like a little not necessarily yeah not](https://youtu.be/tHUcD4rWIuY?t=636) [necessarily A hierarchy but I like to](https://youtu.be/tHUcD4rWIuY?t=639) [group people like these people are in](https://youtu.be/tHUcD4rWIuY?t=642) [this team and these people are in this](https://youtu.be/tHUcD4rWIuY?t=644) [other team and it helps me see like oh](https://youtu.be/tHUcD4rWIuY?t=646) [that's why they they they know each](https://youtu.be/tHUcD4rWIuY?t=648) [other or whatever](https://youtu.be/tHUcD4rWIuY?t=650) [so finally there are three additional](https://youtu.be/tHUcD4rWIuY?t=652) [features I want to show you very](https://youtu.be/tHUcD4rWIuY?t=655) [briefly first](https://youtu.be/tHUcD4rWIuY?t=657) [I implemented a new image annotation](https://youtu.be/tHUcD4rWIuY?t=660) [function that works very similar to](https://youtu.be/tHUcD4rWIuY?t=663) [image](https://youtu.be/tHUcD4rWIuY?t=665) [cropping pick any image on obsidian](https://youtu.be/tHUcD4rWIuY?t=666) [Canvas OR in a markdown note and select](https://youtu.be/tHUcD4rWIuY?t=670) [annotate image in excolo from the](https://youtu.be/tHUcD4rWIuY?t=673) [command pallet this will embed the image](https://youtu.be/tHUcD4rWIuY?t=676) [into excolo where you can annotate it](https://youtu.be/tHUcD4rWIuY?t=680) [and replace the image in the original](https://youtu.be/tHUcD4rWIuY?t=683) [location with the excal version the](https://youtu.be/tHUcD4rWIuY?t=686) [feature comes with settings similar to](https://youtu.be/tHUcD4rWIuY?t=689) [cropping I recommend watching the](https://youtu.be/tHUcD4rWIuY?t=693) [cropping video to get a good](https://youtu.be/tHUcD4rWIuY?t=695) [understanding](https://youtu.be/tHUcD4rWIuY?t=699) [second this is a feature I wanted to](https://youtu.be/tHUcD4rWIuY?t=701) [implement for so long you can now](https://youtu.be/tHUcD4rWIuY?t=704) [reference frames by their names this is](https://youtu.be/tHUcD4rWIuY?t=706) [great when you're creating a](https://youtu.be/tHUcD4rWIuY?t=710) [presentation in exol draw and want to](https://youtu.be/tHUcD4rWIuY?t=711) [author a markdown note that accompanies](https://youtu.be/tHUcD4rWIuY?t=714) [your presentation or simply want to](https://youtu.be/tHUcD4rWIuY?t=717) [print the](https://youtu.be/tHUcD4rWIuY?t=720) [slides finally though this was already](https://youtu.be/tHUcD4rWIuY?t=721) [released two weeks ago I thought I'd](https://youtu.be/tHUcD4rWIuY?t=724) [mentioned the support for multiple](https://youtu.be/tHUcD4rWIuY?t=727) [templates simply set a folder as your](https://youtu.be/tHUcD4rWIuY?t=729) [template in plug-in settings files in](https://youtu.be/tHUcD4rWIuY?t=733) [the folder will be treated as different](https://youtu.be/tHUcD4rWIuY?t=736) [templates for example I have a template](https://youtu.be/tHUcD4rWIuY?t=738) [with normal fonts not the handrawn fonts](https://youtu.be/tHUcD4rWIuY?t=742) [for illustrations I create at work](https://youtu.be/tHUcD4rWIuY?t=744) [because Normal fonts are easier to read](https://youtu.be/tHUcD4rWIuY?t=747) [when presented I have a second template](https://youtu.be/tHUcD4rWIuY?t=750) [with a very small export padding that I](https://youtu.be/tHUcD4rWIuY?t=754) [use when deconstructing images finally I](https://youtu.be/tHUcD4rWIuY?t=757) [have the base template I use for most of](https://youtu.be/tHUcD4rWIuY?t=761) [my drawings multiple templates open so](https://youtu.be/tHUcD4rWIuY?t=764) [many](https://youtu.be/tHUcD4rWIuY?t=768) [opportunities and stay tuned for the](https://youtu.be/tHUcD4rWIuY?t=770) [next video yeah absolutely so
