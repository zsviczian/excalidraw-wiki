![Shade Master - Obsidian-Excalidraw 2.7.3 - Recolor SVGs and Excalidraw Drawings](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ)

# Summary
In this video, Zsolt introduces the new "Shade Master" feature in Excalidraw 2.7.3, which allows users to recolor SVGs and Excalidraw drawings efficiently. He demonstrates how to manipulate elements' hues, saturation, and lightness in real time, showcasing the use of SVG icons and the potential effects of color adjustments. Additionally, Zsolt discusses his upcoming visual thinking workshop, emphasizing its collaborative nature and providing a special offer for prospective participants.

# Key Takeaways
- The Shade Master feature allows simultaneous color adjustments to multiple elements, enhancing visual design workflows in Excalidraw.
- Users can reset SVG colors to their original state and gradually change attributes such as hue, saturation, and lightness.
- The video announces a collaborative workshop on creating a book summary, with a special discount for the first ten sign-ups.

# Content
Hey everyone, it's Zsolt here. I'm super excited about this update! Take a look at this: I open Shade Master, and if I change the hue, then the hue of all the elements in this scene changes. When I change the lightness, I can make this color slightly lighter, and then again I can change the hue. I can change the saturation of the colors. I can make it grayscale if I want. Everything in the scene is changed at the same time. On top of this, this is not only for Excalidraw elements but also for icons that are embedded here as SVG icons. So let me show you how all of this works. You need SVG icons; the icon that I'm using, I downloaded from the Noun Project. You can see here this is the icon. If you create an account, you can download these icons free of charge. Now, if you download an icon—I've already downloaded the icon—I'm going to add it. I'm going to just insert the image, and it's an icon; it's the fireworks from the Noun Project. When you download an icon from the Noun Project, then this is how it's going to look like: you’re going to have this watermark at the bottom. Now, with the cropping feature in Excalidraw, we can easily get rid of that.

So this is so far so good, but then you have this icon here, and the color of this icon cannot be changed. There are no controls to change the colors. This is where the Shade Master script comes into play. If I open the Shade Master script, you will see that this icon actually only has two colors. I'll show you a bit later another icon that has more colors. This icon has two colors, but if I start to change the color, you can see that the icon color in the scene changes. I can also just simply click here and choose a color, or if I already have a color in my scene, then I can do this as well. I can click here, click on the color picker, and select this color, and then apply that color to my icon. This is so far, so good!

Awesome! Now let me explain to you how this thing works. If I come back here, I can click here on "Initialize SVG Colors." This is going to reset the SVG to the original color. What you could see is that when I changed the hue, nothing changed. When I changed the saturation, nothing changed. When I changed the lightness, then suddenly things started to come to light. So, the way this works—and I need a bit more saturation here—I need to explain to you what's going on because once you understand the color theory behind this, then you're going to understand what's going on.

So, I'm heading over to a color wheel, and I'm going to use this site to show you how the color wheel works and how luminosity and saturation work. You can see here that I have a color wheel; I have a single color here, and if I go around the color wheel, this is changing the hue. The hue is a position around the circle, around the 360° of the circle. The hue moves on this scale and moves around the circle. Now here, what you can see are different dots, and horizontally this is the saturation. So, take a look at this: if I move this dot, then you will see that the bottom right color changes from gray to the color as I move here. If a color is not saturated, it means it is gray. If it's saturated, then it has color. Equally, if I take the luminosity, I'm going to move this item here, and it's going to move from a luminous color to down over to black—you can see that—but here in the middle this is actually saturation halfway. 

So that's why I have this toggle here, because that you can see is white. If I move to the center, then that's the base color. If I move out here, this is going to be white—this is white because it has a luminosity of 100% and a saturation of 0%. That means a white color. Essentially, what happens here is when I have an item that's by default black, black has neither lightness nor saturation. If I change this to HSL, then you will see here, well, this is my hacking already: it has a saturation of 0.01% and 0.01% of luminosity as well. But if I now change the lightness, then this is going to start to move to white as the luminosity changes. 

Now, as I turn off saturation, I'm going to start to get a color, and that is because I was at the zero red point. As I move the hue, then I'm moving around the color wheel to the different colors. The way this slider works is it takes you through the color wheel, but it is relative because if you have multiple colors in an icon or multiple icons, then each color is going to be at a different place on the color wheel. Essentially, I'm moving multiple colors around here. 

If we come here, you see this single dot. If I add additional dots here, then I can actually move them together, and that's what the slider does here. But let me add another icon here; I can again open Shade Master. Now you can see that Shade Master has a lot more colors here. First of all, I can change the shading of this, but of course, I can also simply adjust colors. For example, I want this hand to be the same color as my fireworks. Now I've changed that color; I can maybe change this color to be a much stronger pink—whatever! So you understand what's going on here. 

Now if I select multiple icons like this and run Shade Master, I no longer have the color picker. The color picker at the bottom only shows if you have a single SVG icon. If you have multiple SVG icons, then it doesn't show, but you can still change the hue of these elements together. But now, let's go one step further and add an item from my stencil library. I'm going to add the Obsidian icon here from the stencil library because I want to show you something special with this. So let's open Shade Master again and change these colors together. If I now pull the hue, then you can see that both of these items change their colors together. 

You can see that this is now changing the color, but I want to show you what this stroke and background color is useful for. For example, I want to show you that I can change only, for example, the background color. In this case, I'm going to change the transparency of the background color, and you can see here that the background color changed, but the lines are still fully opaque. This is in contrast to just to show you: if I bring the Obsidian icon again, I can change opacity like this as well. But if I change opacity like this, then the stroke color also changes. But in this case, the stroke color remained fully opaque, and only the background color is transparent. 

I think this is a very useful feature in several cases when you don't want the entire object to be transparent. Let me show you. This is now our Obsidian icon nicely blended into the background. Now let's create a second firework here. I'm just going to alt-drag to make a copy of this, and what I want to show you is if I now open Shade Master and change the color of this to maybe this strong orange, then both of these change, which is not necessarily what you want because you might want these to have different colors. For this, you need to understand how Excalidraw in Obsidian stores your image in the background, and then I'll show you the solution as well.

So here, if I open this drawing in markdown view mode like this and open Excalidraw drawing here, then you will see that under embedded files I have this icon only once. You can see here as well that I have my color mapping for that icon after the icon link. Therefore, this icon, no matter how many copies we have in the drawing, is always going to be a single file here. But I have a copy command, so if I click the Obsidian command palette, I can select "Duplicate selected image with different image ID." When I click this, you can see that a new copy of the image was created, and this one is black. So this is back to the default color, and now I can come here and select a different color for this one. I can duplicate, and this way I can add yet another color, whichever you want. 

So here I can now start to play with our different colored fireworks. I think this is super useful in terms of remapping colors and having the same icon with multiple colors—like in the case of my thumbnail for this video. Let me show you how this looks in markdown view mode. So now I have three different versions of this file. You would expect to see here under embedded files three different versions. You can see that they all have a different so-called file ID, but they are the same file in your Obsidian Vault, and each of them has a different color mapping attached. 

That's the basic story of how this is stored. Now, there's one more thing I wanted to show you here, and that is that you can do this recoloring with SVG images, but you can also do this with nested Excalidraw drawings. So if I now insert an image, I'm going to insert the logo of the visual thinking workshop. So this is an Excalidraw drawing. If I click on this, I can open this drawing here, and you can see that this has all the links—oh, all the places that I've used this! Now, if I come back here, I can do the same thing with this. I can open Shade Master and start to change the color of this. 

I want to call your attention to something interesting here: if I change the color, you will see that these dots in the brain inside the drawing—so let me just reset that; you can see it again—now these colors are all the same. But if I drag this, then each of the dots in the brain remains the same color. Why is that? Well, that is because if I come back here, essentially this is not a single—I mean, it is a single image, but the brain here is a "Sketch Node" brain in Excalidraw. This is a separate Excalidraw drawing that I've reused in many different locations. So I'm using this not only in the logo but here as well. Therefore, nested images will not be recolored, but I think in this case, this comes out pretty nice. This is a very interesting look for the logo.

Beyond the fun of recoloring, because you could say, "Hey, Zsolt, why are you recoloring it? You could just simply copy the logo from here, like this, come over here, and then you could apply a different color scheme." Whatever! So I can select this, and I could change the color to this, and that would be an option as well. And you're right; it would be an option. But what I would lose is the connectivity because now this is just an element here, an Excalidraw element here. This doesn't have a link back. Now if I look at the links here, then you will see that this has an outgoing link to the visual thinking workshop. Through that outgoing link, I have a connection because my whole Vault is full of Excalidraw drawings—almost 3,500 drawings—and these illustrations are all interconnected. I'm linking my thinking through icons and images that I nest and reuse, and if I remove this from here, then you will see that the link disappeared from here because this is now just an image; this is not a link.

Now, of course, because this has the brain embedded, therefore I have this "Sketch Node" rough brain in here. But you get the point that the idea of linking is by reusing items, and what the Shade Master script makes possible for you is that you can reuse images and link them even when you're reusing them in different color contexts and you need to create in different looks. You can still reuse the original image. 

So how do you get this? You need to click here on the Obsidian tools panel, and you need to click here to install or update Excalidraw scripts, and here you need to search for Shade Master. There it is! When you click it, you can install the script, and with that, you'll have the Shade Master installed on your machine. Now for this, you will need to update Excalidraw in Obsidian to 2.7.3. 

Finally, as I've shown you the visual thinking workshop logo, I wanted to spend just one minute on the visual thinking workshop. I have a special offer for you that's valid until the end of 2024, so only a couple of days left to use that opportunity, and it's only available for the first 10 people signing up for cohort 12 using that link! But before talking more about that, I wanted to highlight that in cohort 12 we're going to create a collaborative book on a page summary of the lessons of history by Will and Ariel Durant. This is going to work as each of us is going to do a different part of the book on a page, and in the final session, we're going to put it together. This is going to be a super collaborative and super fun workshop!

As I was doing some preparations for the workshop, I read this article by Will Durant, "The Map of Human Character," and he's talking about the definition of history here. I thought that this quote is very interesting, so I wanted to read this to you just very quickly. So it goes like this: "It is a mistake to think that the past is dead. Nothing that has ever happened is quite without influence at this moment. You, too, are your past. Often your face is your autobiography." Later on, he goes on to say that "therefore, I feel that we of this generation give too much time to news about the transitory present and too little to the living past. We are choked with news and starved of history." 

Then he says later on, "But how, without history, can we understand these events, discriminate their significance?" I think this book, in today's environment with all the changes and turbulence, is more timely than ever, and cohort 12 is going to go through this book. I'm super excited! This is such an interesting book. I think the collaborative way of how we're going to put together the book on a page is unique and extremely fun. 

So, I want to encourage you to sign up for cohort 12. The coupon that you see under the video in the comments and in the description gives you 30% off the cohort 12 bundle and the cohort 12 premium bundle. So use it and enjoy the lower cost! The workshop starts effectively on the 25th of January—that's the first workshop date—but keep in mind that the workshop is an interactive practice. We have five sessions to go through in cohort 12. 

Before you do cohort 12, you need to complete the self-paced course, so the bundle includes the visual thinking self-paced course. After you've completed that, you'll be ready for the workshop. Effectively, you can see here there's a chart that explains where you should be in the self-paced course by which session of the workshop. But you know what? You will get the most value out of this if you actually complete the self-paced course and then join the cohort sessions. 

That's why I'm doing it like this: now you have an opportunity to buy the workshop bundle at a reduced price until the end of the year. Then you still have three full weeks to go through the self-paced course and get ready for the workshop. During the workshop, you're going to be fully there and make full advantage of this. I think this package like this is an awesome opportunity to kickstart 2025. Grab this opportunity and join cohort 12 of the workshop at this reduced price! Again, the first 10 people get 30% off, so don't wait—sign up! 

This offer is available until December 31st, midnight Central European Time, so be aware of the time zones! The quicker you click, the more chance you have to get this benefit. So with that, I want to close this video. I think this is going to be the last video of this year, so I want to thank you for bearing with me throughout the year. I still have so many ideas to implement, and I think just this new feature with the Shade Master is such a game changer that I'm super excited about Obsidian, about Excalidraw, about the visual thinking workshop, and overall about visual PKM. 

So join me in the next videos, join me next year, and thank you for watching! Thank you for supporting me on this journey! See you next year and see you at the workshop. Thank you! [* ](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=0)

[can of course do this as well that I can](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=160) [click here I can click on the Color](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=163) [Picker and I can select this color and](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=166) [then I can apply that color to my icon](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=169) [this is so far so good awesome now let](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=174) [me explain to you how this thing in the](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=178) [beginning works so if I come back here I](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=181) [can click here on initialize SVG colors](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=184) [this is going to reset the SVG to the](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=188) [original color and what you could saw](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=191) [see is that when I changed the](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=194) [Hue nothing changed when I changed the](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=197) [saturation nothing changed when I Chang](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=201) [lightness then suddenly things started](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=204) [to come to light so the way this works](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=206) [and I need a bit more saturation here I](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=212) [need to explain to you what's going on](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=215) [here because once you understand color](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=217) [theory behind this then you're going to](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=219) [understand what's going on so I'm](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=222) [heading over to pettin and I'm going to](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=224) [use this site to show you how the color](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=228) [ve works and how luminosity and](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=232) [saturation works so you can see here](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=237) [that I have a color ve I have a single](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=240) [color here and if I go around the color](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=242) [ve this is changing the Hue so the Hue](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=247) [is a position around the circle around](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=251) [the](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=255) [360° of the circle so the Hue moves on](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=256) [this scale and it moves around the](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=261) [circle now here what you can see are](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=263) [different dots and horizontally](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=266) [this is the saturation so take a look at](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=270) [this if I move this dot then you will](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=273) [see that the bottom so this is where you](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=276) [need to look the bottom right color that](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=279) [changes from Gray to the color as I move](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=282) [here and as I move here if a color is](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=287) [not saturated it means it is great gray](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=289) [if it's saturated then it has](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=293) [color and equally if I take](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=296) [the](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=300) [Luminosity I'm going to move this item](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=301) [here and it's going to move from a](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=304) [luminous color to down over to](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=307) [Black you can see that but here in the](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=311) [middle this is actually saturation](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=315) [halfway so that's why I have this toggle](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=318) [here because that you can see is white](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=323) [if I move to the center then that's the](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=326) [base color here if I move out here this](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=329) [is going to be white this is white](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=332) [because this has a Luminosity of 100%](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=335) [And A saturation of 0% that means a](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=340) [white color and essentially what happens](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=345) [here is when I have an item that's by](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=349) [default](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=354) [black black has no lightness and no](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=355) [saturation so if I change this to hsl](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=360) [then you will see here well this is my](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=364) [hacking already that it has a saturation](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=367) [of](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=370) [0.01% and](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=372) [0.01% of uh Luminosity as well but if I](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=374) [now change the lightness then this is](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=379) [going to start to move to white as the](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=382) [Luminosity changes as I turn off such](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=385) [atation then I'm going to start to get a](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=390) [color and that is because I was at the](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=393) [zero red point and then as I move the Q](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=397) [then I'm moving around the color veal to](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=402) [the different colors now the way this](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=406) [slider works is it takes you through the](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=409) [color ve but it is relative because if](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=413) [you have multiple colors in an icon or](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=416) [multiple icons then each color is going](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=419) [to be at a different place on the color](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=422) [wheel so essentially I'm moving multiple](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=424) [colors around here so if we come here](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=428) [you see this single dot if I add](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=431) [additional Dots here then I can actually](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=434) [move them together and that's what the](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=440) [slider does here but let me add another](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=443) [icon here I can again open shade master](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=446) [now you can see that shade master has a](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=449) [lot more colors here first of all I can](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=452) [change the shading of this but of course](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=455) [I can also just simply adjust colors for](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=458) [example I want this hand to be the same](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=462) [color as my fireworks so now I've](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=465) [changed that color I can maybe change](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=468) [this color to be a much stronger](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=471) [pink whatever so you understand what's](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=475) [going on here now if I select multiple](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=478) [icons like this and run shade Master](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=481) [then I no longer have the Color Picker](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=485) [so the color Pickers at the bottom only](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=488) [show if you have a single SVG icon if](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=491) [you have multiple SVG icons then it](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=494) [doesn't show but you can still change](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=497) [the Hue of these elements together but](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=499) [now let's go one step further and let's](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=503) [add an item from my stencil Library I'm](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=507) [going to add the obsidian icon here from](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=511) [the stencil library because I want to](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=514) [show you something special with this so](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=516) [let's open shade Master again and let's](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=520) [change these colors together so if I now](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=523) [pull the Hue then you can see that both](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=525) [of these items change their colors](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=529) [together so you can see that this is now](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=533) [changing the color but I want to show](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=536) [you you what this stroke and background](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=539) [color is useful for so for example I](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=542) [want to show you that I can change](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=546) [only for example the background color](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=550) [and in this case I'm going to change the](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=553) [transparency of the background color and](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=556) [you can see here that the background](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=559) [color changed but the lines are still](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=563) [fully opaque so this is in contrast with](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=567) [just to show you if I bring here the](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=571) [icon again I I have my obsidian icon of](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=574) [course I can change opacity like this as](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=579) [well but if I change opacity like this](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=582) [then the stroke color also changes but](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=585) [in this case the stroke color because I](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=590) [didn't select this stroke color when I](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=592) [was updating this here I didn't select](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=594) [the stroke color therefore the stroke](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=598) [color remained fully opaque and only the](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=601) [background color is transparent I think](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=605) [this is a very useful feature in a](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=608) [number of cases when you don't want the](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=611) [entire object to be transparent now let](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=613) [me show you so this is now our obsidian](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=617) [icon nicely blended into the background](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=620) [now let's create a second firework here](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=624) [so I'm just going to alt drag to make a](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=627) [copy of this and what I want to show you](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=631) [is if I now open shade master and change](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=634) [the color of this to maybe this strong](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=638) [orange then both of these changed which](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=641) [is not necessarily what you want because](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=646) [you might want these to have different](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=649) [colors for this you need to understand](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=652) [how exid draw in obsidian stores your](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=656) [your image in the background and then](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=659) [I'll show you the solution as well so](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=661) [here if I open this drawing in markdown](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=665) [View mode like this and open exol dra](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=669) [drawing here then you will see here that](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=673) [under embedded files I have this icon](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=677) [only once and you can see here as well](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=681) [that I have my color mapping for that](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=683) [icon](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=687) [after the icon link and therefore this](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=689) [icon how many copies we have in the](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=694) [drawing this icon is always going to be](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=698) [a single file here but I have a copy](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=702) [command so if I click the obsidian](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=708) [common pallet I can select duplicate](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=711) [selected image with different image ID](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=715) [when I click this then you can see that](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=719) [a new copy of the image was created and](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=722) [this one is black so this is back to the](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=726) [default color and now I can come here](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=729) [and I can select a different color for](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=733) [this one and again I can duplicate and](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=736) [this way I can add yet another color um](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=742) [whichever you want so here they can now](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=746) [uh start to play with our different](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=750) [colored](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=753) [fireworks so I think this is super](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=754) [useful in terms of remapping colors in](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=757) [terms of having the same icon with](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=759) [multiple colors like in case of my](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=762) [thumbnail for this video let me show you](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=765) [how now this looks in markdown View mode](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=768) [so now I have three different versions](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=771) [of this file so you would expect to see](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=774) [here under embedded files three](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=777) [different versions you can see that they](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=781) [all have a different so-called file ID](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=784) [but they are the same file in your](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=788) [obsidian Vault and they have each of](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=790) [them has a different color mapping](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=794) [attached so that's the the basic story](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=798) [of how this is stored now there's one](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=801) [more thing I wanted to show you here and](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=805) [that is that you can do this](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=808) [recoloring with SVG images but you can](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=811) [also do this with nested excolo drawings](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=815) [so if I now insert an image and I'm](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=819) [going to insert the logo of the visual](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=824) [thinking Workshop so this is an excolo](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=827) [drawing if I click on this I can open](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=830) [this drawing here and you can see that](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=833) [this has the many links uh all the](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=836) [places that I've used this now if I come](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=839) [back here I can do the same thing with](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=842) [this I can open shade](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=845) [master and I can start to change the](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=848) [color of this but I want to call your](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=851) [attention to something interesting here](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=853) [that if I change the color you will see](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=857) [that these dots in the brain inside the](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=861) [drawing so let me just reset that you](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=865) [can see it again now these colors are](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=867) [all the same but if I drag this then](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=870) [each of the the dots in the brain they](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=874) [remain the same color why is that well](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=878) [that is because if I come back here](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=882) [essentially this is not a single I mean](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=885) [it is a single image but the brain here](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=888) [a sketch node brain rough exol draw this](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=893) [is a separate exol draw drawing that](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=896) [again I've reused in many different](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=900) [locations so I'm using this not only in](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=903) [the logo but here as well and](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=906) [therefore and nested images will not be](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=910) [recolored but I think this is actually](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=914) [in this case this comes out pretty nice](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=917) [this is a very interesting look for the](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=920) [logo and Beyond the fun of recoloring](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=924) [because you could say that hey jol why](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=928) [are you recoloring it you could just](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=930) [simply copy the logo from here like this](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=932) [come over here and then you could apply](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=936) [a different color scheme uh whatever so](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=940) [I can select this and I could change the](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=943) [color to this and and that would be an](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=945) [option as well and you're right it would](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=949) [be an option but what I would lose is](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=952) [the connectivity because now this is](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=955) [just](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=958) [an element here an excal element here](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=960) [this doesn't have a link back now if I](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=964) [look at the links here then you will see](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=967) [that this has an outgoing link to the](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=970) [visual thinking](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=974) [workshop and through that outgoing](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=976) [link I have a connection because my](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=979) [whole VA is full of excolo drawings](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=984) [almost almost 3 and a half thousand](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=988) [drawings and these illustrations are all](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=991) [interconnected I'm linking my thinking](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=994) [through icons and images that I nest and](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=998) [reuse and if I remove this from here](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=1002) [then you will see that the link](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=1006) [disappeared from here because this is](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=1009) [now just an image this is not a link now](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=1011) [of course because this has the brain](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=1014) [embedded therefore I have this sketch](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=1016) [note rough brain in here but you get the](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=1019) [point that the idea of linking is by](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=1022) [reusing items and what the shade Master](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=1027) [script makes possible for you is that](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=1032) [you can reuse images and Link them even](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=1035)

article by V Durant](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=1158) [the map of human character and he's](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=1163) [talking about the definition of History](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=1166) [here](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=1168) [and I thought that this quote here is](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=1169) [very interesting so I wanted to read](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=1173) [this to you just very quickly so it goes](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=1175) [like this it is a mistake to think that](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=1178) [the past is dead nothing that has ever](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=1182) [happened is quite without influence at](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=1185)

they](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=1195) [goes on to say that therefore I feel](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=1198) [that we of this generation give too much](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=1201) [time to news about the transan present](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=1204) [too little to The Living Past we are](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=1208) [choked with news and starved of

[event discriminate their](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=1222) [significance and I](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=1225) [think this book](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=1227) [in today's environment with all the](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=1229) [changes all the turbulence in the world](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=1231) [is more timely than ever and cohort

book I think the](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=1243) [collaborative way of how we're going to](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=1245) [put together the book on a page

in](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=1290) [cohort](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=1293) [12 but before you do cohort 12 you need](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=1294) [to complete the self-based course so the](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=1299) [bundle includes the visual thinking](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=1302) [self-paced](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=1305) [course and after you've

the workshop but you know what you](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=1321) [will get the most value out of this if](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=1324) [you actually complete the self-paced](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=1327) [course and then join the cohort sessions](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=1330) [and that is why I'm doing it like

[price until end of the year then you](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=1344) [still have three full weeks to go](https://youtu.be/ISuORbVKyhQ?t=1347) [through the self-pace course and
