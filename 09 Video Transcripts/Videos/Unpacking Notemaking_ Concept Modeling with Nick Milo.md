![Unpacking Notemaking: Concept Modeling with Nick Milo](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A)

# Summary
In this video, Nick Milo and Zsolt discuss the distinction between note making and note taking, emphasizing the importance of conceptual modeling as a powerful tool for organizing and clarifying thoughts. Milo explores the process of creating a concept map, which involves diagramming key ideas and their relationships to enhance understanding and articulation of concepts. The conversation also highlights how visual representation aids in externalizing thoughts, leading to greater insight and intellectual capital.

# Key Takeaways
- Concept modeling is an essential technique that helps clarify ideas and vocabulary in a structured visual format.
- Note making is an active process that generates insights and creates intellectual assets, while note taking often involves passive collection of information.
- Visual PKM (Personal Knowledge Management) practices, such as concept mapping, can significantly enhance one's understanding and retention of complex ideas.

How do you feel about the process? [* ](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=0)

Well, I want to keep going, and this is not art, this is thinking. You know, it's really neat to see what I like to do. I like the idea of a spark because it has such an energy around it. [* ](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=2)

Nick, it's great to meet you here at the PKM Summit in the Netherlands. It's an awesome opportunity, and you told me about the book that you're working on. [* ](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=17)

Yes, it’s great to see you in person, Zsolt. Finally, I am working on a book at the end of a book proposal, and one of the things that I've been trying to get right is not making, which I believe is something far different than note taking. That's truly what I'm trying to figure out. [* ](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=20)

Because of your visual expertise, you mentioned a model that maybe can help. [* ](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=37)

So, I thought that concept modeling would be a good first step in terms of if I were writing a book, I would definitely start with creating a concept model. [* ](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=51)

A concept model is a simple visual that consists of some shapes with text in it. Those are the concepts, typically nouns, and some lines that connect these concepts, which are typically verbs. [* ](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=60)

You can see here that concept modeling organizes a vocabulary and creates a glossary. Of course, the glossary is something that clarifies your vocabulary. Concept modeling is also a diagram about defining terms and definitions. [* ](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=82)

It is just a very practical technique in terms of getting the ideas that are in your mind onto paper and crystallizing a consistent, clear, and ambiguity-free vocabulary. [* ](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=102)

So, I thought maybe this is something that we could do together for a topic from your book. [* ](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=115)

I'm really excited to see how the concept modeling approach can do for me because a lot of the terms in this space need a good definition, especially with something like note making. I feel the need to really nail this down so it can be a definition and an idea that lasts the test of time. [* ](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=121)

Absolutely. So let's give it a try. Okay, what do we do? [* ](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=143)

Indeed, so first of all, you want to create a new Excalidraw. Please go ahead; you can use the ribbon button right on the left-hand side and just click that, and you have a blank drawing now. [* ](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=146)

I would recommend turning on the grid because it helps you organize better. So that’s a right-click and show grid. [* ](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=165)

From here on, it's pretty easy going. You select a rectangle, create a rectangle somewhere, and type in your key idea. Okay, so that's your central idea that you're going to be working on; so it’s note making. [* ](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=176)

Then start to think about other terms. You can even create a parking lot of items. If you hold down the Option key, you can drag this and make copies of this. [* ](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=188)

In the parking lot, I recommend adding some of the nouns that come to mind in this space, and then we start to connect them. Each one in their own box. [* ](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=205)

If you want to be stylistically consistent, typically concepts have a capital starting letter, but yeah, that’s just I like that. [* ](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=212)

The first thing that comes to mind with note making is that it is active; it’s engaged. You can’t not be active if you're making, so it's the opposite of passive. [* ](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=231)

We have to lean forward, and so maybe we can already add active. The way you would create this is you mentioned note making is active, so I would put active below note making. [* ](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=240)

I would drag the active and put it below, and then I would add an arrow. You can pick an arrow from up there, all right. Drag it from note making and kind of hover here ideally, yeah. [* ](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=257)

And just drag it there, press Enter, and type in “is.” Oh, I see, and so this way you define the relationship. Typically, in a concept map, if you follow the arrow and read the words, then it forms a sentence. [* ](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=286)

So note making is active, so you've created a statement, and really the concept map is the set of statements that interconnect. Whichever way you read it, you come up with short sentences that explain what you mean by the concept. [* ](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=303)

Is it okay to take a peek back at the model? [* ](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=311)

So we have concept modeling as a technique that enables essentially understanding and analyzing. It creates a glossary. Okay, I'm getting a sense here of the verbs. [* ](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=327)

Should I just stick with “active” or whatever I think is the most important descriptor? Yes, I think. And an important point is that with every modeling, there's no right or wrong. [* ](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=336)

This is about clarifying your ideas, and by putting it on paper, you're able to reflect on them. It is this process of externalization and then reflection that will help you refine your ideas. [* ](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=349)

I think doing it visually is just a very efficient way before you get to writing it on paper because then you get your vocabulary right, and your writing is going to be much cleaner. [* ](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=372)

I see that this was already effective to do. Are there verbs or what's a good next step here? [* ](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=381)

So maybe I would still try to capture some of the other nouns that for you are important when you're trying to explain to someone what note making is. [* ](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=392)

One thing that's important because of notes and this idea is that oh, it's so abstract and everything is to help people realize you’re already doing this thing. [* ](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=403)

It's probably just in our heads, and we need to externalize it and see it. We’re actually creating the note; we’re making notes up here. We say things like, "hm, that's interesting," and we ask why something’s interesting. That's making a note about something. [* ](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=420)

I want to capture that— that’s making a note about something. We're already doing it. [* ](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=428)

I guess it’s probably something about that, like... already doing it, I guess. [* ](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=430)

Yeah, we can always change it. So what I was thinking is when you talk about note making, you probably should also talk about the ingredients. [* ](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=441)

What am I making the note about, or what’s my input? Note making is based on what, like something that sparks? Are we talking about maybe based on a spark or based on an idea or based on a book highlight, based on a concept, or a purpose? I think those are all things that can be based on now. [* ](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=453)

Okay, let’s see here. For sure, “based on” is going to go on your arrow. I think a spark is, for example, yes, and then we can even add it. Maybe this one I would think that goes up there, but again this is a spatial organization. [* ](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=483)

I think an important aspect of the whole process because in the end, you're going to remember these things spatially. [* ](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=510)

What’s the undo? Right down there, or command Z? [* ](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=518)

But that’s on the Y— no, no, no, it’s down there. Yeah, okay. The keyboard layout is in Hungarian, but the actual layout is in English, so it’s super confusing. [* ](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=525)

Well, I'm just—okay. Don’t worry that the lines aren’t straight; again this is not art, this is thinking, you know. [* ](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=539)

It’s really neat to see. I was thinking what I like to do. I like the idea of a spark because it has such an energy around it and it feels fundamental, it feels universal. There’s a spark, and that can take the form of information, an idea, or a highlight from something. [* ](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=548)

But I love spark because it’s general, but it has a certain energy around it. So yes, it can be based on a lot of things, but I’d love to continue thinking—like spark is how to talk about it. [* ](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=570)

Okay, so note making is active; it’s based on a spark and oh yeah, yeah, yeah. [* ](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=577)

This is good. So if I remember correctly, I kind of was looking back at this to see if I could find any good verbs. I was like, "Okay, I love creates." Is this okay to kind of do? Can I kind of steal with pride? [* ](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=585)

So that’s always the best solution. All right, I know it creates, and one of the things that's really valuable about making a note is that I feel that we're creating an intellectual asset. [* ](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=600)

We’re creating intellectual capital that we can then use in ways that we can't foresee. [* ](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=614)

Sometimes we know it’s like, “Oh, I have this project and it has a conclusion; I will make a note and I will create some thoughts around it, and then I will communicate that thought.” [* ](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=621)

Other times, it’s not clear, and the value of a note is revealed over time. I know that sounds woo-woo, but it happens. [* ](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=630)

It’s just something that sparks based on a spark. If we create it, it gives us an opportunity to come back to it, and then it can inform our work, our efforts, our projects, our experiences. [* ](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=641)

So based—okay, so creates—uh, I don’t know exactly; that’s good. [* ](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=656)

I like because “value” is the kind of straightforward general. I could get kind of—I could, you know, say “intellectual assets.” Let’s see how both look, and I'm curious what you think which one we should... and also you can drive this further. [* ](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=668)

As you saw in the example, concept modeling is a technique that enables understanding, visualization, sharing; so you can also say that note making creates value that is. [* ](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=680)

And then you build it like that. Let’s do that! [* ](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=693)

Yes, because fun because value is the fundamental aspect. So I do like defining it that way initially. Creates—um and that’s that. [* ](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=710)

And if you press five, that will also give you the arrow, so that’s a shortcut that just helps you point. [* ](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=714)

Here’s a question—I could say that leads to—yes, good—that leads to intellectual assets. [* ](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=720)

I also—I’ll do it this way. I also am very underrated, and I always like to end with, I think, the deeper meaning, like that creates personal meaning. [* ](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=735)

Um, personal meaning? And then do you branch from here? [* ](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=749)

Well, so you can just draw an arrow. So press five again and just start your arrow from the text, or you can start from back there. You can start from there as well. Okay, so that’s also a solution. [* ](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=759)

Excellent! Probably could—I feel like there’s another one that we can add. [* ](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=766)

Okay. Value leads to intellectual assets—personal meaning. Oh, here's a really, really important one. Whereas note making is typically how I’d like to define it, excuse me, note taking. [* ](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=786)

We are taking information; we’re not doing anything. That’s what a highlight would look like where we’re just highlighting from someone else’s work or clipping an article, but we’re just taking it. [* ](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=791)

Now, if we talk about note making and this process of creating value, what does that mean? It’s leading to new cool assets that you can use. [* ](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=806)

In fact, I don’t want to start with assets, so I'll change this in a second. It’s generating insights. [* ](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=812)

It’s generating insights, and I kind of want to get—I probably need to figure out how to explain why it’s generating insights, because it’s forcing us to have conversations. [* ](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=824)

So I’m not sure if I do as active and ‘enforces’—oh, that creates value based on is active. [* ](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=842)

I mean I could say encourages to be a little bit lighter about it, but... [* ](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=855)

[Music] [* ](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=859)

Unique ideas and perspectives. [* ](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=866)

All right, so then I can go ahead and do that quick pause. Do we need anything or do we? [* ](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=874)

Well, there is the closing happening right now. [* ](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=885)

Yes, but maybe we can actually wrap up. I think in terms of the process, talking through all of this is probably long for a video. [* ](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=892)

So let’s then do that wrap up. [* ](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=898)

Nick, how do you feel about the process? [* ](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=913)

Well, I want to keep going. So yeah, I just want to keep going! This has been wonderful, Zsolt; it’s really clarified my ideas, and I know I have an artifact I can come back to whenever I need to. [* ](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=919)

Yes, and it was a joy seeing you expand on your ideas. I think great job, and I hope you continue the mapping. [* ](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=923)

I will, and you'll see it in the book in a couple of years: "Linking Your Thinking," hopefully that's the title, and it's going to have a huge section on note making. [* ](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=938)

Thank you, and now we got to go to the closing session of the conference. We got to go to the close. [* ](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=949)

We’ll see you. [* ](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=955)

something that clarifies](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=85) [your vocabulary and then concept](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=88) [modeling is also a](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=91) [diagram and

[together for a top from your book okay](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=117) [yeah because I'm really excited to see](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=121) [how the concept modeling approach can do](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=122) [for me because a lot of the terms in](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=126) [this space need a good definition and so](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=128) [especially with something like note](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=132) [making I do feel the need to really nail](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=133) [this down so it can be a definition and](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=136) [an idea that lasts the test of time](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=139) [absolutely so let's give it a try okay](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=143) [what do we do yeah indeed so first of](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=146) [all you want want to create a new excolo](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=149) [drawing so you will please go ahead you](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=151) [can use the ribbon button right on the](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=154) [left hand side and you just click that](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=157) [and you have a blank drawing now I would](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=160) [recommend turning on the grid because](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=162) [they just helps you organize better so](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=165) [that's a right click and show grid okay](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=167) [and so from here on it's pretty easy](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=170) [going you select a rectangle you create](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=173) [a rectangle somewhere and you typee in](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=176) [your key idea okay so that's your](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=179) [central idea that you're going to be](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=183) [working on so it's note making okay and](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=185) [then start to think about other terms so](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=188) [maybe even create a parking lot of items](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=191) [so you can if you hold down the option](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=194) [key you can drag this and make copies of](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=196) [this okay and in the parking lot I](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=199) [recommend adding some of the nouns that](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=202) [come to mind in this space and then we](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=205) [start to connect them okay and each one](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=207) [in their own box each one in their own](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=209) [box and if you want to be](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=212) [stylistically um consistent then](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=215) [typically Concepts have a capital](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=218) [starting letter but yeah that's just I](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=221) [like that so yeah the first thing that](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=225) [comes to mind with Note making is that](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=227) [it is active it's engaged you can't not](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=231) [be active if you're making so it's a the](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=236) [opposite of pass](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=239) [we have to lean so so we can even yeah I](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=240) [just put lean forward](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=245) [and and so maybe we can already act add](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=248) [active so the way you would create this](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=252) [you mentioned notem is active so I would](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=254) [put active below note making so I would](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=257) [just drag the active and put it below](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=261) [and then I would add an arrow so you can](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=264) [pick an arrow from up there all right](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=267) [and drag it from not making and kind of](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=269) [hover here ideally yeah or yeah indeed](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=272) [so and just drag it there and then press](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=275) [and enter and type in is oh I see and so](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=277) [this way you define the relationship and](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=283) [typically in a concept map if you follow](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=286) [the arrow and you read the words then it](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=289) [forms a sentence so not making is active](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=292) [so you've created a statement and really](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=297) [the concept map is the set of statements](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=300) [that interconnect and whichever way you](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=303) [read it you come up with short sentences](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=306) [that](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=309) [explain what you mean by the concept is](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=311) [it okay to take a peek back at the the](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=313) [model okay so we have concept modeling](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=315) [is a technique that enables essentially](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=319) [uh enables understanding analyzing okay](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=324) [uh creates glosser okay okay I'm getting](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=327) [a sense here so the verbs okay and so](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=330) [how would I would should I just stick](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=334) [with active or whatever I think is the](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=336) [most important descriptor yes so I I](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=338) [think and an important point so I think](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=342) [as with every modeling there's no right](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=345) [or wrong this is about clarifying your](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=349) [ideas and by putting it on paper you're](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=352) [able to reflect on them it is is this ex](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=356) [this process of externalization and then](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=361) [reflection that will help you refine](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=363) [your ideas and I think doing it visually](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=366) [is just a very efficient way before you](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=370) [get to writing it on paper because then](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=372) [you get your vocabulary right and your](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=375) [writing is going to be much cleaner okay](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=377) [um so I see that this was already](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=381) [effective to do is are there are verbs](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=383) [or what's a good Next Step here as far](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=386) [as where I should](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=388) [so maybe I would I would still try to](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=390) [capture some of the other nouns that for](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=392) [you are important when you're trying to](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=395) [explain to someone what not making is](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=397) [yeah so one one thing that's important](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=401) [because of notes and this idea of oh so](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=403) [so abstract and everything is to to help](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=405) [people realize you're already doing this](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=408) [thing is probably just in our heads and](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=410) [we need to externalize it and see it and](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=413) [actually create the note but we're we're](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=416) [making notes up here we we say things hm](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=417) [that's interesting and we we say why](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=420) [something's interesting that's making a](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=422) [note about something and so I want to](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=425) [capture that that's making a note about](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=428) [something um we're already doing it I](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=430) [guess it's probably something about that](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=432) [like](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=434) [already doing it I guess yeah we can](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=435) [always change it yeah so what I was](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=439) [thinking is when you talk about note](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=441) [making](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=443) [probably if I were doing this I would](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=445) [also talk about the in](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=448) [ingredients ingredients well so what am](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=450) [I making the note about or or what's my](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=453) [input so note making is based on what](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=457) [like something that Sparks are we](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=461) [talking about maybe based on a spark or](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=462) [based on an idea or based on a b um a](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=465) [book highlight based on a a concept uh a](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=469) [purpose I think those are all things](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=473) [that can be based on now okay okay so](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=476) [let's see here so for sure based on I'm](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=480) [just going keep that there Al so the](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=483) [based on is going to go on your on your](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=485) [arrow so I think a spark is for example](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=489) [yes and then we can even add it maybe](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=493) [this one I would think that goes up](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=496) [there but but again this is a a spatial](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=500) [organization I think is a an important](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=504) [aspect of the whole process because in](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=508) [the end you're going to remember these](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=510) [things spatially mhm and yeah what's the](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=512) [undo right down there or command command](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=518) [Z but that's on the Y no no no no it's](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=521) [down there yeah okay yeah so the the](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=525) [keyboard layout is in Hungarian but the](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=528) [actual layout is in English so it's](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=531) [super confusing to look at this](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=534) [skateboard well I'm just okay yeah it's](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=536) [because of but don't don't worry that](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=539) [the lines aren't straight again this is](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=541) [not art this is thinking you know it's](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=542) [really neat to see um I was thinking](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=545) [what I like to do I like the idea of a](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=548) [spark because it has such an energy](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=550) [around it and it feels fundamental it](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=552) [feels Universal there's a spark and and](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=554) [that can take the form of information](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=558) [idea um a highlight from something but I](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=560) [love spark because it's it's General but](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=563) [it has a certain energy around it so yes](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=565) [it can be based on a lot of things but](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=568) [I'd love to to continue thinking like](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=570) [spark as how how to talk about it okay](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=573) [so not making is active it's based on a](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=577) [spark and um oh yeah yeah yeah so okay](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=580) [this is good so if I remember correctly](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=585) [and I I kind of I was looking back at](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=587) [this to see if I could find any good](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=588) [verbs and I was like okay I love creates](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=590) [is this okay to kind of do you kind of](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=593) [yeah steal with pride so that's always](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=594) [the best solution all right so I know](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=598) [it's creates and what I'm thinking is](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=600) [okay and one of the things that's really](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=602) [valuable about making a note is that I](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=603) [feel that we're](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=607) [creating a an intellectual asset so](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=608) [we're creating intellectual Capital that](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=612) [we can then use in ways that we can't we](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=614) [can't ex foresee how exactly sometimes](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=617) [we know it's like oh I have to I have](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=619) [this project and it has a conclusion I](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=621) [will make a note and I will create some](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=623) [thoughts around it and then I will](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=625) [communicate that thought other times](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=627) [it's not clear clear and the value of a](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=628) [note is revealed over time I know that](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=630) [sounds wooy but it happens it's just](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=633) [something that Sparks based on a spark](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=635) [but if we create it it gives us an](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=638) [opportunity to come back to it and then](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=641) [it can inform our work our efforts or](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=643) [projects our experiences So based okay](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=646) [so creates uh value um I don't know](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=650) [exactly that's good I](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=654) [like I because values the kind of](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=656) [straightforward General and I could say](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=660) [I could get kind of I could you know say](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=663) [intellectual assets let's see how both](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=665) [look and I'm curious what you think](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=667) [which one we should and also you can you](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=668) [can drive this further so as you saw on](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=670) [the example that concept modeling is a](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=672) [technique that enables understanding](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=676) [V visualization sharing so you can also](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=680) [say that note making creates value that](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=684) [is and then you and](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=688) [value build it like that let's do](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=690) [that](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=693) [so yeah because fun because value is the](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=695) [fundamental aspect so I do like defining](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=698) [it that way initially creates and](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=702) [that's that](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=705) [um um and if you press five that will](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=710) [also give you the arrow so that's that's](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=714) [a shortcut that that just helps you](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=716) [point all right so](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=717) [it here's a question I could say that](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=720) [leads to is that yeah that's good that](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=723) [leads to intellectual assets I](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=726) [also I'll do it this way I also in very](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=730) [underrated and I always like to end with](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=735) [I think the the deeper meaning M like](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=737) [that](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=741) [creates um deep meaning yeah I might](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=742) [just do p well we could do I'll do](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=744) [personal let me do personal](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=747) [meaning](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=749) [um yeah personal](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=752) [meaning and then do you do you Branch](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=755) [from here or well so you you can just](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=759) [draw an arrow so press five again and](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=761) [and just start your arrow from the text](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=763) [or you can start from up there you can](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=766) [start from there yeah you can start from](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=768) [there as well okay so that's also a](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=769) [solution](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=772) [excellent probably could I feel like](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=775) [there's another one that we can add okay](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=777) [value that leads to intellectual assets](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=779) [personal meaning oh okay here's here's a](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=781) [really really important one is that](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=783) [whereas not making is typically how I'd](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=786) [like to Define it excuse me note taking](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=788) [we are taking information we're not](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=791) [doing anything so that's what a a](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=794) [highlight would look like where we're](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=796) [just highlighting from some someone](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=797) [else's work where we're clipping an](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=799) [article but we're just we're just taking](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=801) [it now if we talk about note making in](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=803) [this process of creating value okay what](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=806) [does that mean it's leading to new cool](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=808) [assets that you can use in fact I I](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=812) [don't want to start with assets so I'll](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=814) [change this in a second um it's](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=815) [generating insights so it's generating](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=819) [insights it's](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=824) [um insights and I kind of want to get I](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=827) [probably need to figure explain why it's](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=830) [generating insights because it's forcing](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=832) [us to have conversations so I'm not sure](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=834) [if I do is active and](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=836) [and um en forces oh](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=839) [forces H creates value based on is](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=842) [active um I mean I could say encourages](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=849) [to be a little bit um lighter about it](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=852) [but](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=855) [[Music]](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=859) [um](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=860) [unique](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=863) [ideas and perspectives](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=866) [all right so then I can go ahead](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=871) [and do](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=874) [that quick pause do we anything or do we](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=878) [well there is the closing happening](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=883) [right now yeah yeah but maybe we can](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=885) [actually wrap up so I think in sense of](https://youtu.be/ztCup77A77A?t=888)
