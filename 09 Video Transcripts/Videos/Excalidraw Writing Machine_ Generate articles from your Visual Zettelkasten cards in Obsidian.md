![Excalidraw Writing Machine: Generate articles from your Visual Zettelkasten cards in Obsidian](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs)

# Summary
In this video, Zsolt presents an innovative method for transforming visual layouts of articles created in Excalidraw into well-structured PDF documents. He discusses the principles of Visual PKM (Personal Knowledge Management) and demonstrates how to use the Excalidraw Writing Machine script alongside AI tools in Obsidian to generate content from Zettelkasten notes. The flexibility of the workflow allows users to tailor the process to their specific needs, whether or not they want to involve generative AI.

# Key Takeaways
- Visual PKM enables the creation of documents by visually organizing ideas and utilizing tools like Excalidraw and Obsidian.
- The Excalidraw Writing Machine script allows users to convert their visual notes into structured articles and PDF formats, making the writing process more streamlined and efficient.
- Incorporating generative AI tools can enhance the writing process, but users can adapt the workflow according to their preferences, like omitting AI or templating features.

# Content
Hey everyone, it's Zsolt here. Welcome to Visual PKM. In today's video, I want to show you how you can convert this visual layout of an article into this PDF document that looks good and reads well. The flow of the text makes sense, and there are nice illustrations. Overall, it's a document that's almost publishing-ready. Of course, it is not publishing-ready; you would need to do some more work, but this is a pretty good start for an article. [* ](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs)

So before we dive into the guts of the conversation, I just want to highlight that what I'm going to show you today is fully adaptable to your needs. If you dislike generative AI, you can skip that part. If you don't want to create custom Templater scripts, you can skip that part as well. The workflow is adaptable to how far you want to go with it. [* ](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs)

Now, before jumping into the actual solution, there are two things I want to talk about just to set the scene. Thing number one is the promise of Zettelkasten. Practically any book you read on this subject will show you this promise: that if you have a good Zettelkasten system, then you will never start from scratch, be it a blog post, a video, or an article. You will not need to start from scratch because you can simply pick up a branch from your Zettelkasten system, lay out the cards, and bang, you have a good draft—a good first draft of your article. All you need to do is stitch it together. Now, I've always been envious of this, and today I think I have a solution that can actually make this happen. [* ](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs)

The second part of setting the scene is about the promises or claims I make in the mindset Visual Thinking framework I advocate for: four-dimensional PKM and visual Zettelkasten. So let's look at these two topics. Four-dimensional PKM can be best understood bottom-up. What is two-dimensional PKM? Well, the first dimension is the text documents that you're writing, and I call this linear text because you need to read from the top left to the bottom right, or of course, if your language reads from a different direction, then follow that direction. That's dimension number one: your linear text. [* ](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs)

The second dimension includes the separate documents that you're creating; each document is its own file in your file system. You can elevate your game by implementing three-dimensional PKM. In my understanding and interpretation, this is what Thiago Forte and Nick Milo advocate—advocates of three-dimensional PKM. The third dimension is the links between your notes. So if you have a two-dimensional PKM but add links between keywords and files, sort of like your own Viki system, then the third dimension appears here—that's the links. Now, what's the fourth dimension? Well, the fourth dimension is when you start to add illustrations. It's not only about adding illustrations but also when you start to reuse illustrations—like icons and parts of images—and use those images across various notes to connect ideas. I call this the next dimension because the way we process information visually is very different from how we process text. Text we process linearly, while visuals we process in a parallel way. [* ](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs)

A good mindset to demonstrate how linear text differs from a visual note is to think about a shop receipt versus a shop window. Which one is faster if you want to find out what the shop is selling? [* ](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs)

Now, the other concept I want to talk about is visual Zettelkasten. This builds on the concept of having notes that have two sides: a visual side and a textual side. Let me show you in this case if I select my note here and open the backside of the note. The backside is the markdown side of this note, and here I have all sorts of text notes that are related to this. Again, if I flip this over to Excalidraw view mode, then I can see the drawing. If I flip this over to markdown view mode, then I can see the markdown side of the document and my notes. Of course, you can achieve this not only with Excalidraw; for example, the slides in PowerPoint act in a similar way. But my idea is, or my advocacy is, that this way you can include your visual representation—your visual summary—on a card on the front and supporting background information like your sources, a summary of the idea, and related notes on the back of the card. [* ](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs)

So my promise is as follows: by visually organizing your ideas, you get to something that's much more powerful than shuffling bullet points. And this is where the whole idea of visual Zettelkasten comes in: that you have your notes as visual Zettelkasten notes. Each of these cards is an individual Zettelkasten node that you can switch over or flip over to see what's on the backside, but when you need to organize your ideas, you can organize it at this visual level. [* ](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs)

Now, these were the setting-the-scene topics. There’s one more thing I wanted to bring in here, and that is Ted Blizzard, who approached me yesterday with an email. He shared with me his idea or vision for the paper writing machine. This is practically a tool that helps academics produce documents with citations, and this builds on the whole idea that we talked about until now with the Zettelkasten system. You read books, articles, and take notes on the web, capturing all of these in your Zettelkasten notes, and from this, you can create maybe via a data view query, maybe with other tools, you can create an outline of your paper and then convert that into a document that's maybe a Word document or Google Docs or whatever. So this is the solution that I want to show you today. [* ](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs)

The components of the solution that we are going to look at are a visual layout in Excalidraw, and we're going to look at that in just one second. It's an Excalidraw script—the Excalidraw writing machine script. It's ChatGPT, Obsidian Templator, and AI4 Templator as two additional plugins on top of Excalidraw, and it's a Templator template. Again, you can go as far or as little as you like. So let's start with this visual layout that you can follow. So this is the basic concept that I want to show you first, and then we'll look at the actual example that we looked at in the beginning. [* ](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs)

The way this works is the Excalidraw writing machine script will go through your sequence of arrows and capture the text from the different elements. Here, it will start with the main title, then the next lines—until there's a fork in the road—are just going to be paragraphs within that main title or under the main title. Then you have a fork in the road; the first text, be it on the arrow or be it a separate text element, is going to be your section heading, and again, it's going to be followed by the paragraphs that follow in a linear way. Later on, if you have a Zettelkasten note like in this case, so again, I can show you this is a Zettelkasten node that is a very simple node. I have this source section that says "the mindset framework," and the idea here is that this is the concept. So if you have this layout, then you need to select the very first element in your sequence, and you need to run the Excalidraw writing machine script. [* ](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs)

Then I run the script; I can choose a template to use. Now, I'm going to select another file and press Escape. I'll explain this later. For now, all I want to do is not to use a template, and you can see the end result. So there's the main title; that's a level two heading. Then I have paragraph 1, 2, and 3. Then I have section 2 with paragraph 1 and 2, and then I have section 2 with paragraph 2. I have the image, under the image I have the text that we saw on the back, and I have the source here in brackets afterward—I have the reference to the source for this note. This is the output that the script generates. [* ](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs)

So now let’s look at how you can use this output. I'm going to close this and head over to my writing machine demonstrations page. Now, before getting going, I want to show you how to install the Excal writing machine script. It's pretty simple: you need to click here on the Obsidian tools panel, and you need to select the first button that's install or update Excalidraw scripts. Once it loads, you need to just type in "writing machine." It will take you to this link to the Excal writing machine, and you can click here to install the script. [* ](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs)

What you can see here are my cards from the book on a page summary for "Atomic Habits." So each of these cards—if you can look at this—each of these cards is a visual Zettelkasten node. On the back of the card, I have some data here about the source, about the idea. I have my 360-view of the idea and so on. There's lots of content here for each of the cards. As I was creating these cards, I was creating each of them as a Zettelkasten note in my system. But of course, each of these comes from somewhere in James Clear's book, and you can see that I've created this flow that starts with the book cover, then there's a brief introduction of what this article is going to be about. Then I continue on with four sections in my article: tiny actions can lead to big differences, why focus on identity, and why system is crucial, etc. You can read these. [* ](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs)

So if now I click on "Atomic Habits," I again start the writing machine script. Again, I'm not going to choose the templater script. I’m going to select another file. The reason you see this menu is the first time you run the script, but we'll look at that you will not see this menu, but only the next one. But if you’ve already selected a template, it’s going to be offered to you. If I choose to select another file and press Escape, then it means that I'm not using any template. So when I do this, you can see that this document was created. It's the same as the document we looked at in this case, so it follows the same logic. You can see here the images, the text, and here you go. Here's the stitched together material, and each of these sentences that you see here are the sentences that I wrote to capture my ideas about that specific permanent note that I created as a visual permanent note. [* ](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs)

Now, if you want to stop here, great! You can stop, and you can take this document and start to type and improve your text. I think you've already achieved a lot because you have a visual layout of how you organized your text. You generated the document from that, and from then on, you can start to work on this document. But if you want to use AI, then you have a simple option: you can simply select everything and copy this to the clipboard and then head over to ChatGPT. In ChatGPT, I already have my prompt here, so you’re an expert in academic writing and so on. You can pause the video and read it here. I’m going to paste the text that was generated by the Excalidraw writing machine here and just press enter. This is how ChatGPT is going to do its magic. It's going to generate the article. I've asked ChatGPT to generate the article and return the result as a Markdown code block. That's why here I’m receiving this Markdown code block. The text is ready, and I’m going to scroll up to the top of the text and just copy the code like this. I'm going to head back to Obsidian and just simply press paste. [* ](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs)

Here I can see that, unfortunately, in this generation, something happened to the images. No, nothing happened to the images. Good, it just needed time to load the images. So you can see that the article is ready. This is how it looks. There’s a bit of a guide here, and yeah, so you can read this. I've done several runs. Of course, as with GPT, it's always slightly different, but I think it's good enough. [* ](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs)

That's option one if you want to further automate this. Then your next option is to use AI4 Templator. So AI4 Templator, I’m going to be using two scripts really. So let's come to the community plugin, and I'm going to show you first of all AI4 Templator. This is an excellent plugin for running ChatGPT queries from Templater. So you need to install AI4 Templator, and of course, you need to install the Templator plugin as well. Once you have those installed and configured, then you will need a template as well. This is the template that I created. I'm going to include this link, upload this somewhere, and include the link in the video description so you will not need to start from scratch. Practically this is a very simple template. I’m going to close these two files. [* ](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs)

It defines a system message, a user prompt, and uses a model. Now about the models, I found that, well, GPT-4 Mini is a very low-cost model. GPT-4 latest is a slightly more expensive model, but frankly, with all my testing, I’ve spent around 50 cents or less over the two days, so it is really not a huge amount of money. The reason I chose these two models here is that they allow for more output tokens. Normally, this is 4,096—the maximum limit, for example, for GPT-4. These two models allow more, and since the article can be bigger, I went for this, and that’s almost about it. [* ](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs)

There are two more—actually three more things I want to show you here just so you understand what's going on. Then the Excalidraw writing machine script runs; at the end, it will place the generated text on the window.ewm. So when the Templator script is executed, it can take the value from window.ewm and submit it to ChatGPT. So that’s point number one. Point number two, the way I developed this Templator script to help with debugging—finding errors—is that before closing, it will place on window.ewm response again on the window object; it will store all these variables so you can go to the developer console and find out what has happened. And I think the third and most important point here is that I introduced in the writing machine script a placeholder that wherever this is found in the template that you provide, it is replaced with the generated text. This is good because this way you can include the original text in your template. I'll show you in a second how this will work. [* ](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs)

That’s about the Templator file, and now let’s come here and run our script. So I'm going to start the writing machine and I'm going to use my template here, and then I press enter. Then you will see that the page was generated and you need to pay attention to these bubbles in the top-right corner; they will go on for quite a while. Just as ChatGPT takes time responding, it takes its time in this case as well, so you will need to wait a little for this to finish the generation. And there you go, the generation is ready. You can see some stats about the generation, and we have the actual document here. So this is a pretty nice document. Well, I mean, it's similar to the previous one that we looked at at the beginning. I'm not going to go into the details. I'm going to upload that PDF again; we’ll include the link in the video description so you can take a look at what was generated. [* ](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs)

So the script comes with settings, but the first time you need to run it once for the settings to appear. So let me show you what I mean. If I come to Excalidraw plugin settings, at the bottom of settings for installed scripts, now you will see that I have the Excal writing machine here, but that's because I've developed the script. It’s not in my downloaded folder. You can see here, so this is actually for you—not going to be here; nothing is here. But once I run the script for the first time, I need to select an element, and I need to start writing machine. You can see that now I have two writing machine scripts here, and I’m going to run the downloaded version. I’m just going to press Escape because I don't want to use a template at this time. If I press Escape here, it means that whatever is generated is generated into a completely blank document. So when I do this, then this document was generated. If I come back to settings, I can scroll down to the bottom of settings for installed scripts, and you can see that the downloaded Excal writing machine is here, and there are a couple of settings you can do. You can change the name of the summary section. In my case, I use "the idea" in all my notes, so instead of "summary," I call it "the idea." Whatever you call it, you can type it in here. You can set where the source is, so that’s a section called "source." The template path you don’t need to worry about. Then you select a template from the dropdown list that’s going to be filled out automatically, and this is where the script stores its last used template. Finally, you can choose to embed the images or not to embed. If I turn this off, then I'm going to close this and run the script again. So if I come here, then the same text is generated, but without the images, so you can get rid of the images as well. [* ](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs)

That’s about installing the script. Now, if you want to edit the script—which you might actually want to do because there are some—my mindset here is this is a working prototype, but as many people have many Zettelkasten systems, there is no way of configuring it exactly the way you need it. That is the power of Excalidraw scripts. So if I come here to the Excalidraw folder and scroll down to scripts and download it here, then if I scroll down, I’m going to find the Excalidraw writing machine here. If I click on this, then the script opens, and yes, you need a bit of scripting skill to edit this. I tried to add some comments here and there so that it’s easy to follow. It is not a very complicated script, but of course, what’s complicated and what’s simple is a very relative scale. So I can understand if this is scary. If it is, then just stick to the settings. If you know what you’re doing or if you want to experiment, because what have you to lose? If you mess it up, you download it again; there's nothing to lose, then I think it's a good place to start. Also, pro tip: you can just select the whole thing, head over to ChatGPT, and ask ChatGPT to modify it this and that somehow you want to modify it, and you can just simply paste the script here and then you can use ChatGPT to do whatever updates you need with this script. [* ](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs)

On a final note, there's one important thing that you need to understand regarding how the text is generated and how arrows are interpreted. The sequence of how you create the arrows is important. So let me just show you what I mean. Here, I'm going to write, "This is going to be my title." Then this is going to be section one, and this is going to be section two. Here I'm going to have paragraph 1, 1 and paragraph 1, 2. Here I'm going to have paragraph 2, 1 and paragraph 2, 2. Now let me show you how you can confuse the system. This is good to know if you want to avoid this. So I'm going to first draw the arrow to section two, and I’m just going to use these nice elbow connectors. Then I’m going to select section one, and from here, I can just simply continue drawing the line. So I'm just going to finish this off. What you’re going to see now is if I just generate this with the writing machine script, I don’t want it like this. So if I generate this, you can see that section two is at the top, followed by section one, which is not ideal. [* ](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs)

So what I can do instead is I can delete this and delete this, and then I can come back and add first section one and then section two. Now if I run this again, then you will see that now section one is first and then section two. So this solves this problem, and that’s all I wanted to share with you today. I hope you found it as exciting as I did. I think this opens up so many opportunities for visually organizing your ideas into flows. You can create presentations, you can create show notes. I’m going to be using this to create scripts for my videos. There are many use cases that you can do. I think this is such a nice opportunity, and hopefully, you can also use these scripts to customize them to your needs. Please, in the comments, I’d be very interested in how you use this, what you thought of the entire process, and what you’re missing from all of this. [* ](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs)

Finally, if you find this useful and interesting and want to learn more about the mindset visual thinking framework and personal knowledge management, then take a look at the links below. Check out the visual thinking workshop and join one of the next cohorts. I’d love to show you more about the framework, and of course, in the office hours of the visual thinking workshop, we have time to discuss other topics, including scripting and automating in Obsidian. So that’s just an additional opportunity that you can gain from the workshop. Thank you. [* ](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs)

In this video, I demonstrate the Excalidraw Writing Machine (EWM) script, which converts a visual layout of an article into a draft writing. The layout can include text elements or visual Zettelkasten notes. The script follows the arrows between nodes to generate a hierarchical Markdown document. By feeding this document into generative AI like ChatGPT, you can quickly produce a nearly publish-ready draft, making it easier to create academic articles, blog posts, presentations, and more.

The solution shown in the video was created with https://Obsidian.md, the Excalidraw-, Templater-, and AI for Templater plugins.

to](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=36) [highlight that what I'm going to show](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=38) [you today is fully adaptable to your](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=40) [needs if you dislike generative AI you](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=43) [can skip that part if you don't want to](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=47) [create custom templator scripts you can](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=50) [skip that part as well the workflow is](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=53) [adaptable to how far you want to go with](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=56) [it now before jumping into the actual](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=58) [solution there are two things I want to](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=62) [talk about just to set the scene thing](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=64) [number one is the promise of zel](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=68) [Cen practically any book you read on](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=71) [this subject you will see this promise](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=75) [that if you have a good zle Casten](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=77) [system then you will never start from](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=80) [scratch be it a blog post a video an](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=83) [article whatever you're working on you](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=86) [will not need to start from scratch](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=89) [because you can simply pick up a branch](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=91) [from your zettle Caston system lay out](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=94) [the cards and bang you have a good draft](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=97) [a good first draft of your article all](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=101) [you need to do is to stitch it together](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=104) [now I've been always envious of this and](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=107) [today I think I have a solution that can](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=110) [actually make this](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=113) [happen the second part of setting the](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=115) [scene is about the promises or claims I](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=118) [make in the mindset visual thinking](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=122) [framework I advocate for](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=125) [four-dimensional PKM and for visual](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=128) [thatle Casten so let's look at these two](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=131) [topics 4D PKM can be best understood](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=134) [bottom up so what is two-dimensional PKM](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=138) [well the First Dimension are the text](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=142) [documents that you're writing and I call](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=145) [this linear text because you need to](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=148) [read from the top left to the bottom](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=151) [right or of course if your language](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=153) [reads from a different direction than](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=155) [following that direction and that's](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=158) [Dimension number one your linear text](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=160) [the second dimension are the separate](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=163) [documents that you're creating each](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=166) [document its own file maybe in your file](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=169) [system you can elevate your game by](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=173) [implementing threedimensional PKM and in](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=176) [my understanding and my](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=179) [interpretation this is what Thiago Forte](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=182) [and Nick Milo are advocating they're](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=185) [Advocates of 3D PKM the third dimension](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=188) [is the links between your notes so if](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=192) [you have a two-dimensional PKM but you](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=195) [add links between keywords and files](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=198) [sort of like your own Viki system then](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=202) [Wikipedia then the third dimension](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=206) [appears here and those are the links now](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=209) [what's the fourth dimension well the](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=212) [fourth dimension is when you start to](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=214) [add illustrations and it's not only](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=217) [adding illustrations but when you start](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=220) [to reuse illustrations like icons and](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=222) [parts of images and use those images](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=226) [across various notes to connect ideas](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=230) [and I call this a next Dimension because](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=234) [the VY processing information is very](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=237) [different from how we process text text](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=241) [we process linearly visuals we process](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=244) [in a parallel way so a good mindset to](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=249) [demonstrate this](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=253) [how a linear text differs from a visual](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=254) [note is if you think about a shop](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=258) [receipt versus a shop window which one](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=262) [is faster if you want to find out what](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=265) [the shop is selling](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=267) [now the other concept I want to talk](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=270) [about is visual thatle](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=274) [castan this Builds on the concept of](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=277) [having notes that have two sides a](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=281) [visual side and a textual side so let me](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=285) [show you in this case if I select my](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=288) [note here and open the back side of the](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=292) [note so the back side is the markdown](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=296) [side of this note then here I have all](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=299) [sorts of text notes that are related to](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=302) [this again if I flip this over to exol](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=305) [dra View mode then I can see the drawing](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=307) [if I flip this over to markdown View](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=310) [mode then I can see the markdown side of](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=312) [the document and I can see my notes of](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=317) [course you can achieve this not only](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=320) [with excolo for example the slide notes](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=322) [on slides in PowerPoint act in a similar](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=326) [surve but my idea is or my advocacy is](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=329) [that this way you can include your](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=333) [visual representation your visual](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=335) [summary on a card on the front and](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=338) [supporting background information like](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=341) [your sources like the summary of the](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=343) [idea like related notes on the back of](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=346) [the card and so my promise is the](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=348) [following that by visually organizing](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=353) [your ideas you get to something that's](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=357) [much more powerful than shuffling bullet](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=360) [points and this is where the whole idea](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=363) [of visual zle castan comes in that you](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=367) [have your notes as visual zle castan](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=369) [notes each of these cards are an](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=372) [individual zettle castan node that you](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=375) [can switch over or flip over to see](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=377) [what's on the back side but when you](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=380) [need to organize your ideas you can](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=382) [organize it at this visual level now the](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=384) [these were the setting the scene topics](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=389) [there's one more thing I wanted to bring](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=393) [in here and that is Ted blizzard who](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=395) [approached me yesterday with an email](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=399) [and he shared with me his idea or vision](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=402) [for the paper writing machine this is](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=405) [practically a tool that helps academics](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=408) [produce documents with citations and](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=412) [this Builds on the whole idea that we](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=415) [talked about until now with the zettle](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=417) [cting system that you're reading books](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=420) [articles take notes on the web and you](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=423) [capture all of these in your zle casting](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=427) [notes and from this you can create maybe](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=431) [VI a data view query maybe with other](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=435) [tools you can create an outline of your](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=437) [paper and then you can convert that into](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=441) [a document that's maybe a ver document](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=444) [or Google Docs or whatever so this is](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=447) [the solution that I want to show you](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=450) [today so the components of the solution](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=454) [that we are going to look at are a](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=457) [visual layout in exol draw and we're](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=459) [going to look at that in just one second](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=462) [it's an exol dra script it's the exol](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=464) [dra writing machine script it's ch GPT](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=468) [obsidian templator and ai4 templator as](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=473) [two additional plugins on top of exol](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=476) [and it's a templator template and again](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=480) [you can go as far or as little as you](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=483) [like so let's start with this visual](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=487) [layout that you can follow so this is](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=491) [the basic concept that first I want to](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=494) [show you and then we'll look at the](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=496) [actual example that we looked at the](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=500) [beginning so this the way this works is](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=502) [the script the exol draw writing machine](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=506) [script will go through your sequence of](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=510) [arrows and capture the text from the](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=514) [different elements so here it will start](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=517) [with the main title then the next lines](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=521) [until there's a fork in the road are](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=525) [just simply going to be paragraphs](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=528) [within that main title or under the main](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=530) [title and then you have a fork on the](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=533) [road then the first text be it on the](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=536) [arrow or be it a separate text element](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=539) [is going to be your section heading and](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=543) [again it's going to be followed by the](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=546) [paragraphs that follow in a linear way](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=548) [later on and if you have a z castan note](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=551) [like in this case so again I can show](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=554) [you this is a zle Casta node that is a](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=556) [very simple node so I have this Source](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=560) [section that says the mindset framework](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=564) [and the idea that this is the idea so if](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=567) [you have this layout then you need to](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=570) [select the very first element in your](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=574) [sequence and you need to](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=577) [run](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=580) [the excal through writing machine script](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=582) [then I run the script I can choose a](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=586) [template to use now I'm going to select](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=590) [another file and press Escape I'll](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=593) [explain about this later for now all I](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=595) [wanted to do is is not to use a template](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=598) [and you can see the end result so](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=602) [there's the main title that's a level](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=604) [two heading then I have paragraph 1 two](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=606) [and three then I have section 2 one here](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=610) [with paragraph one and two and then I](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=614) [have section 22 and I have paragraph 22](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=618) [one I have the image under the image I](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=622) [have the text that we saw on the back](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=625) [and I have the Source here in Brackets](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=628) [afterwards uh so I have the reference to](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=631) [the source for this note so this is the](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=634) [output that the script generates so now](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=637) [let's look at how you can use this](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=641) [output I'm going to close this and I'm](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=643) [going to actually head over to my](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=646) [writing machine demonstrations uh page](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=649) [now before we get going I want to show](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=654) [you how to install the exol writing](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=656) [machine script it's pretty simple you](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=660) [need to click here on the obsidian tools](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=663) [panel and here you need to select the](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=666) [first button that's install or update](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=670) [excal draw scripts and once it loads you](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=673) [need to just type in](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=676) [writing machine it will take you to this](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=679) [link to the excal writing machine and](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=682) [you can click here to install the](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=686) [script so what you can see here are my](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=690) [cards from the book on a page summary](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=693) [for Atomic habits so each of these cards](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=696) [if you can look at this each of these](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=699) [cards you're not going to be very](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=702) [surprised or a visuals that will cost a](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=704) [no so on the back of the card I have](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=707) [some data here about the source about](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=711) [the idea I have my 360 view of the idea](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=714) [and so on on so there's lots of content](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=718) [here for each of the cards as I was](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=721) [creating these cards I was creating each](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=724) [of them as a z Casta note in my system](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=726) [but of course each of these comes from](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=731) [somewhere in uh James clear's book and](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=733) [you can see that I've created this flow](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=737) [that it starts with the book cover then](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=740) [there's a brief introduction of what](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=744) [this article is is going to be about and](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=748) [then I continue on with four sections in](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=751) [my article tiny actions can lead to Big](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=755) [differences why focus on identity and on](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=759) [system is crucial Etc you can read these](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=762) [so if now I click on Atomic habits and](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=766) [again I](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=771) [start the writing](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=772) [machine writing machine script again](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=777) [still I'm not going to choose the](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=780) [templator script I'm going to select](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=782) [another file the reason I see this menu](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=785) [first time you run the script but we'll](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=789) [look at that you will not see this menu](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=791) [but only the next one but if youve](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=793) [already selected a template it's going](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=795) [to be offered to you if I choose to](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=797) [select another file and press Escape](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=800) [then it means that I'm not using any](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=802) [template so when I do this you can see](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=805) [that this document was created it's the](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=808) [same as the document we looked at in](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=810) [this case so it follows the same logic](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=814) [you can see here the images the text and](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=817) [here you go so here's the stitched](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=820) [together material and each of these](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=823) [sentences that you see here are the](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=826) [sentences that I wrote to capture my](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=829) [ideas about that](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=832) [specific permanent note that I created](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=834) [as a visual permanent](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=837) [note and now if you want to stop here](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=839) [great you can stop and you can take this](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=843) [document and start to type and improve](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=846) [your text and and I think you've already](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=849) [achieved a lot because you have a visual](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=852) [layout how you organize your text you](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=855) [generated the document from that and](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=859) [from then on you can start to work on](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=861) [this document but if you want to use AI](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=864) [then you have a simple option you can](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=868) [just simply select everything and copy](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=871) [this to the clipboard and then you can](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=874) [head over to CAD GPT and in CAD](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=877) [GPT I already have my prompt here so](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=882) [you're an expert in academic writing and](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=886) [so on you can pause the video and read](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=889) [it here and I'm going to paste](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=891) [the text that was generated by excolo](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=896) [writing machine here and I'm just going](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=901) [to press enter and with this chpt is](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=903) [going to do its magic it's going to](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=907) [generate the article I've asked chpt to](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=910) [generate the article uh](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=915) [into return the result as a markdown](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=918) [code block so that's why here I'm](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=921) [receiving this markdown code block the](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=925) [text is ready I'm going to scroll up to](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=928) [the top of the text and just copy the](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=931) [code like this I'm going to head back to](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=933) [obsidian and just simply press paste and](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=937) [here I can see that unfortunately in](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=941) [this generation now something happened](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=944) [to the images no nothing happened to the](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=947) [images good it just needed time to load](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=950) [the images so you can see that the](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=953) [article is ready um this is how it looks](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=956) [so there's a bit of a guide here and](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=960) [then yeah so you can read this I've done](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=963) [several runs of course as with GPT it's](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=967) [always slightly different but I think](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=970) [it's good enough so](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=973) [that's option one if you want to further](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=976) [automate this then your next option is](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=979) [to use AI for templator so AI for](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=983) [templator I'm going to to be using two](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=987) [scripts really so let's come to](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=990) [community plugin and I'm going to show](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=992) [you first of all AI](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=995) [for templater so this is a an excellent](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=998) [plugin for running CH GPT queries from](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1002) [TFT hacker so you need to install ai4](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1007) [templator and of](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1010) [course you need to install the templator](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1012) [plugin as well once you have those](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1015) [installed and](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1018) [configured then you will need a template](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1019) [as well this is the template that I](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1023) [created I'm going to include this link](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1026) [upload this somewhere and include the](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1030) [link in the video description so you](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1032) [will not need to um start from scratch](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1034) [practically this is a very simple](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1039) [template I'm going to close these two](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1041) [files](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1044) [um it defines a system message a user](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1045) [prompt uses a model now about the models](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1050) [I found that well GPT 40 mini is a very](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1054) [low cost model chbt 40 latest is a](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1059) [slightly more expensive model but](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1064) [frankly with all my testing I've spent](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1065) [around 50 cents or less over the two](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1069) [days so it is really not a huge amount](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1073) [of money the reason I chose these two](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1076) [models here is because they allow for](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1081) [more output tokens normally this is](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1085) [4,096 the maximum limit for example for](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1091) [GPT 40 these two models allow more and](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1094) [since the article can be bigger I went](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1099) [for](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1102) [this and and that's almost about it](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1103) [there are two more](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1107) [actually three more things I want to](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1109) [show you here just so you understand](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1111) [what's going on then the EXC colro](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1113) [writing machine script runs at the end](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1117) [it will place the generated text on](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1121) [window.](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1124) [ewm so when the templator script is](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1126) [executed it can take the value from](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1130) [window. ewm and use that to Sol submit](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1134) [to Chad GPT so that's Point number one](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1139) [point number two the way I develop this](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1143) [templator script to help with debugging](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1146) [finding errors is before closing it will](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1149) [place on ewm response it again on the](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1155) [window object it will store all these](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1160) [variables so you can go to developer](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1163) [console and find out what has happened](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1166) [and I think the third and most important](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1170) [Point here is I introduce so in the](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1172) [writing machine](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1177) [script I](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1180) [introduced this placeholder that](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1182) [wherever this is found in the template](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1185) [that you provide it is replaced with the](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1188) [generated text and this is good because](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1191) [this way uh you can include the original](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1194) [text in your templat I'll show you in a](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1200) [second how this will work here so that's](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1202) [about the templator file and now let's](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1207) [come here and run our script so I'm](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1210) [going](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1214) [to start writing machine and I'm going](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1215) [to use my template here and then I press](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1219) [enter then you will see that the page](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1223) [was generated and you need to pay](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1226) [attention to is these bubbles in the top](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1227) [right corner they will go on for quite a](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1231) [while just as CH gbt to get time](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1234) [responding it takes its time in this](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1238) [case as well so you will need to wait a](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1241) [little for this to finish the](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1244) [generation and there you go the](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1247) [generation is ready you can see some](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1249) [stats about the generation and we have](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1251) [the actual document here so this is a](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1255) [pretty](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1258) [uh nice document well I mean it's](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1259) [similar to the previous one that we](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1261) [looked at at the beginning I'm not going](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1264) [to go into the details I'm going to](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1266) [upload that PDF again we'll include the](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1268) [link in the video description so you can](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1272) [take a look at what was](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1275) [generated so the script comes with](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1280) [settings but the first time you need to](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1282) [run it once for the setting to appear so](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1285) [let me show you what what I mean if I](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1288) [come to excal draw plug-in settings at](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1292) [the bottom of settings settings for](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1295) [installed scripts now you will see that](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1298) [I have the excal writing machine here](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1301) [but that's because I've developed the](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1304) [script and it's not in my downloaded](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1307) [folder you can see here so this is](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1310) [actually for you not going to be here](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1312) [nothing is here but once I run the](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1316) [script for the first time so I need to](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1318) [select an element and I need to start](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1321) [writing machine you can see that now I](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1325) [have two writing machine scripts here](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1328) [and I'm going to run the downloaded](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1331) [version and I'm just going to press](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1334) [Escape because I don't want to use a](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1336) [template at this time if I press Escape](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1339) [here it means that whatever is generated](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1341) [is generated into a completely blank](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1344) [document so when I do this then this](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1347) [document was generated and if I come](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1350) [back to settings I can scroll down to](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1352) [the bottom of settings for installed](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1355) [scripts and you can see that downloaded](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1358) [excolo writing machine is here and there](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1361) [are a couple of settings you can do you](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1364) [can change the name of the summary](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1367) [section in my case I use the idea in all](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1370) [my notes so instead of summary I call it](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1374) [the idea whatever you call it you can](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1377) [typee it in here you can set where the](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1380) [source is so that's a section called](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1383) [Source the template path you don't need](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1386) [to worry about it then you select a](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1388) [template from the dropdown list it's](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1391) [going to be filled out automatically and](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1393) [this is where the script stores](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1395) [its last use template and finally you](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1399) [can choose to embed the images or not to](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1403) [embed so if I turn this off](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1406) [then I'm going to close this and I'm](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1409) [going to run the script](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1412) [again so if I come here and then the](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1415) [same text is generated but without the](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1421) [images so you can get rid of the images](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1424) [as well so that's about installing the](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1427) [script now if you want to edit the](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1432) [script which you might actually want to](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1434) [do because there are are some so my](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1437) [mindset here is this is a working](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1440) [prototype but as many people as many zle](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1444) [cast and system so there is no way of](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1448) [configuring it exactly the way you need](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1451) [it and that is the power of exol draw](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1453) [scripts so if I come here to the exol](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1456) [draw folder and come down to scripts and](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1460) [download it here then if I scroll down](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1463) [I'm going to find the Skol draw writing](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1467) [machine here and if I click on this then](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1470) [the script opens and yes you need a bit](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1474) [of scripting skill to edit this I tried](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1478) [to add some comments here and there that](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1481) [it is easy to follow it is not a very](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1485) [complicated script but of course what's](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1488) [complicated and what's simple is a very](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1491) [relative scale so I can understand if](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1494) [this is scary and if it is then just](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1496) [stick to the settings if you know what](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1499) [you're doing or if you want to](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1501) [experiment because what have you to lose](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1503) [so if you mess it up you download it](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1505) [again there's nothing to lose then I](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1507) [think it's a good place to start also](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1510) [Pro tip you can just select the whole](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1514) [thing head over to Chad GPT and ask Chad](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1516) [GPT to modify it this and that somehow](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1521) [you want to modify it and you can just](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1526) [simply baste the script here and then](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1529) [you can use CH GPT to do whatever](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1532) [updates you need to do with this script](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1536) [on a final note there's one important](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1538) [thing that you need to understand on how](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1541) [the text is generated and how arrows are](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1543) [interpreted the sequence of how you](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1547) [create the arrows is important so let me](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1549) [just show you what I mean here I'm going](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1552) [to write this is going to be my title](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1554) [and then this is going to be section one](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1558) [and this is going to be section two and](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1562) [then I'm going to have H paragraph one](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1566) [one and paragraph one2 and here I'm](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1570) [going to have paragraph 21](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1575) [and paragraph 22 and now let me show you](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1581) [how you can confuse the system so this](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1586) [is good to know if if you want to avoid](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1589) [this so I'm going to first draw the](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1592) [arrow to section](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1595) [two and I'm just going to use these nice](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1596) [uh elbow connectors and then I'm going](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1600) [to select section one and from here I](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1603) [can just simply continue on drawing the](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1607) [line so I'm just going to finish this](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1610) [off and what you're going to see is now](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1613) [if I just generate](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1617) [this with the writing machine script I](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1621) [don't](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1624) [want like this so if I generate this you](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1625) [can see that section two is at the top](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1628) [followed by section one which is not uh](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1631) [ideal so what I can do instead is I can](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1635) [just simply delete this and delete this](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1640) [and then I can come back and add first](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1645) [section one and then section two and](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1648) [now if I run this](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1653) [again then you will see](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1657) [that now section one is first and then](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1661) [section two so this solves this problem](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1664) [and so that's all I wanted to share with](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1668) [you today I hope you found it as](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1671) [exciting as I did I think this opens up](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1673) [so many opportuni these for visually](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1676) [organizing your ideas into flows you can](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1679) [create presentations you can create show](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1683) [notes I'm going to be using this to](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1687) [create scripts for my videos there's](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1689) [many use cases that you can do I think](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1691) [this is such a nice opportunity and](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1696) [hopefully you can also use these scripts](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1699) [to customize them to your needs and](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1702) [please in the comments I'd be very](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1705) [interested in how you use this what you](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1707) [thought of the entire process and what](https://youtu.be/zvRpCOZAUSs?t=1710) [you're missing from all of this
