Hey everyone, Jolt here! Excalidraw comes with an infinite canvas, and with an infinite canvas come infinite opportunities. Today, I want to give you a feature walkthrough of some of the enhancements I've made that allow you to customize embeddable elements; namely, you will be able to scale embedded elements, as well as add significantly more control over markdown embeds, including almost 100% canvas candy support, as well as other settings and opportunities. [* ](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=0)

But before we dive into the new features, I want to demonstrate the issue that we're facing. Imagine you have this video embedded, but you actually want this video to be smaller because you’re maybe inserting it next to something that is already an image that has a size, and the video should fit that image or for whatever other reason. Now you can start to decrease the size of the video, but you can see that at a certain point, the video becomes pretty much unusable and unwatchable because of the relative scale of the video. When I press play, yeah, this is not a very pleasant watching experience. Now this way it is, but overall, the whole experience is not very good. [* ](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=45)

Now, the same applies to the markdown embeds as well. So, here’s my embedded document, and I can scroll here, I can navigate here—this is great, I’m happy with this document. However, if I now want to make this smaller, I come up to a similar problem: yeah, I can make it smaller, but in the end, only the title fits, which is really not that great. What I’m after is more like this fractal type of experience where I can add additional detail to my drawing. I can make use of the full 10% to 3000% zoom range of Excalidraw, and if I want to add some tiny detail next to a point, I want to be able to add that detail. [* ](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=90)

So let me show you how this works on a concrete example. I've created this overview here about my various videos and thoughts on visual Zettelkasten, and you can see that here in the center, I have a video about the two sides of the card and flipping the card—the card being Excalidraw and the Excalidraw markdown view. Around it, in different categories, I have references to other videos. And if I zoom in here, then these videos also look proper: the YouTube button size is okay, the relative size of these videos is okay, and even I can go to the next level. You can see here my next video, and of course, if I play these, then they will look proper; you have the properly sized YouTube controls here, and everything works as expected. [* ](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=180)

You might also notice that on the side, I have these markdown documents, which are my literature notes for these topics. These documents are editable, and they look proper. Again, they’re scaled down to this side, so if I zoom out, then you can see that those are actually teeny tiny, especially compared to the ones we wanted to do previously. So just compare these two and the look and feel between the two. [* ](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=245)

So how do I do this? There are a couple of new features. First of all, let’s pick up this video, and let me show you one new feature. If I zoom into this video and let’s say this is the scale where I want to watch the video, there’s a new command palette action. I just type in "scale selected embeddable elements to 100% relative to the current canvas zoom." You can see the canvas zoom currently is 487 percent. So when I select this action, my video is resized such that it looks good at this zoom ratio. [* ](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=310)

I can do the same with my markdown document. So here again, I can just type in "scale selected element," and then I choose this. You can see that now the markdown embed was scaled down, and you can edit it right here. So how do you scale? One way to scale is to use the command palette action I just shown you. The other way to scale is you can find the properties button. If I press "properties," then here I can simply use this toggle to change the zoom ratio. I can zoom in and zoom out, or scale in and scale out. If I want to find the relative size to be 100%, that’s the same as the scaling function in the command palette. Then I can press this button, and it will automatically identify the scale. Also, you can simply add a start time to your video, so if there’s a particular point where you want to start the video, then you can add that start time here, and it will be saved to your video. I’m not going to press okay; I’m just going to leave it like this. [* ](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=378)

So that’s one set of functions in terms of scaling. The other set of functions is: you might have noticed that this document here looks different compared to these two documents. These documents had a sketchy background, and they had a different color, and they had some border colors. So I want to show you some of the settings now available. First of all, I have a setting that has been there already for some time: the embeddable will follow the theme of your Excalidraw drawing. So if here I switch to dark mode, then the embeddable will switch to dark mode as well. I think this is a nice feature if you like your theme and you like the light and dark versions of your theme; then your drawing is always going to follow that. You have other options as well that this always follows the Obsidian theme. But what I want to show you is the properties window right here because this document has significantly more properties now. [* ](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=444)

You don’t see the properties because I have this turned on to use Obsidian defaults; that’s why it looks like this. But if I turn this off, then you will see that I have lots of options. For example, I can hide the file name, as well as I can choose that the element follows either the background of the canvas or the background color of the element itself. I can set the opacity of that background color; maybe I’m going to set this to 80%, so it is a strong background color, but I can still see the sketch in the background. I can also select whether I want the element border color to match the stroke color of the element, or I can choose a different color here, by the way, that’s through here as well. So if I don’t want to match the element background color and I don’t want to match the canvas background color, then I can also choose a color that I want my embeddable to have. [* ](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=516)

For example, I’m just setting this embeddable to this pinkish color like this, and I’ve hidden the file name. I’m going to add now, this way, a strong red border color. Then I press "okay." You can see, well, I’m not sure this is an ideal combination of colors, but you can see that for example, I was able to configure this like this. If I now choose to follow the element background color, I can remove this opacity to 80% or reduce it. I follow the stroke color and press "okay." Now it is black because I have a transparent background; but if I now change the background color here, so if I choose a background color, then that background color is going to be applied to my drawing. You can also see that if I change the fill pattern, then the fill pattern changes here as well, and also I can play with the element border, etc. This gives you lots of freedom in terms of how you want to manage the background color and the background look and feel of your markdown embedded document. [* ](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=592)

You can even make this whole thing transparent. The way to make it transparent is simply to reduce the opacity to 0%. If I do this, then now I can also hide the background color. With this, I’m able to add a markdown document that is fully immersive in my Excalidraw. Finally, let me show you some of the CSS formatting options. In this case, I’m going to demonstrate to you some of the canvas candy formatting options. So let me just walk you through some of these options. I’m just going to copy these from here and apply them to my document, so you can see the effect of the different options. This is making the note transparent, or I can pick up the next one, and I can add this, and this is going to add a label to the right. TF hacker has done some real magic here with these CSS classes. In this case, I can rotate the text in the box by 45° or, in this case, I can create a dashed border around this. [* ](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=670)

Now, of course, you can argue that you have the dashed border anyway, so here I can create a dashboard or align my drawing like that. You can see my Excalidraw dashes, but if you want this more canvas-looking dash, then you can choose this as well. Finally, you can even add shapes to these elements; so, in this case, this is going to make the note a circle shape, which is also a pretty cool feature. So the bottom line is now Excalidraw supports the CSS classes in the front matter. If you're not using canvas candy, you can create your own CSS classes as well, and you can format the notes in Excalidraw. [* ](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=743)

Finally, let’s look at some of the settings. In settings, you can set the default for the markdown embedded. You can see here that this is under Excalidraw, and you need to go to embedded files in Excalidraw. You’ll find the interactive markdown files settings. You see exactly the same settings that I’ve shown you with the properties, but here you can set the default, and then every time you insert a new markdown document, that is going to follow this default. Finally, if you use Excalidraw together with Obsidian canvas, I implemented a new setting for you as well. In this case, I have this drawing of this end, and I’m going to drop this drawing onto the canvas like this, and you can see that this is now dropped in without a border around the note and it’s transparent. [* ](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=822)

Let me show you some of the settings that I’ve done so that I can insert this drawing like this onto the canvas. First of all, you need to go to Excalidraw settings, and here under "embedding Excalidraw into your notes and exporting," you need to scroll down to "Obsidian canvas support." Under Obsidian canvas support, you can turn on immersive embedding, which will remove the border around the embedded object. Now, that might not be enough, so in this case, in this drawing, I switched over to markdown view mode. I added this front matter switch to export my drawing with a transparent background. You can configure this in plugin settings as well, but I typically don’t do this. So I applied this front matter switch here; if I remove this and I come back to the drawing and I save it, then if I come back here, you see that the drawing would be embedded like this. It still doesn’t have the border on canvas, but it’s not so immersive. [* ](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=883)

So if you want a fully immersive experience, then you need to switch to markdown view mode and you need to add the "excal export transparent" through, and with that, you will be able to export a note that doesn’t have the background color. It will look fully immersive on your canvas. So that’s all I wanted to share with you today in terms of these new features. I am super excited about these new features; I think they open up so many new opportunities for thinking visually, and I’m keen to know how you're using these features. I invite you to join the visual thinking Discord server. You can just simply click the link here on the splash screen, and there in the Showcase section, I would love to see examples of how you're using Excalidraw to think visually, how you're using this new feature, as well as on their feature requests and in the other sections; we can talk about enhancements and how you would want to take this plugin further. Thank you! [* ](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=909)

[should fit that image or for whatever](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=59) [other reason now you can start to](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=62) [decrease the size of the video but you](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=64) [can see that at a certain point the](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=67) [video becomes pretty much unusable unw](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=70) [watchable because of the relative scale](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=75) [of the video and when I press press play](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=79) [then yeah this is not a very pleasant](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=82) [watching experience now this way it is](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=85) [but overall the the whole experience is](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=88) [not very good now the same applies to](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=92) [the markdown EDS as well so here's my](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=96) [embedded document and I can scroll here](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=99) [I can navigate here this is great I'm](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=102) [happy with this document however if I](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=104) [now want to make this smaller I come up](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=108) [to a similar problem that yeah I can](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=111) [make it smaller but in the end only the](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=113) [title fits which is really not that that](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=117) [great what I'm after is more like this](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=120) [fractal type of experience where I can](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=124) [add additional detail to my drawing I](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=128) [can make use of the full 10% to](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=131) [3,000% zoom range of exol draw and if I](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=135) [want to add some tiny detail next to a](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=139) [point I want to be able to add that](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=142) [detail so let me show you how this works](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=146) [on a a concrete example so I've created](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=149) [this overview here about my various](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=153) [videos and thoughts on visual Z Casten](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=157) [and you can see that here in the center](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=161) [I have a video about the two sides of](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=163) [the card and flipping the card the card](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=166) [being exol draw and the exol draw](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=169) [markdown View and around it in different](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=172) [categories I have references to other](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=175) [videos but then and if I zoom in here](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=178) [then these videos also look proper so](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=181) [the YouTube button size is okay and the](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=184) [relative size of these videos are okay](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=187) [and even I can go to a Next Level and](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=191) [you can see here my next video and of](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=194) [course if I play these then they will](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=198) [look proper you have the proper sized](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=200) [YouTube controls here everything works](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=203) [as expected and you might also notice](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=206) [that here on the side I have these](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=209) [markdown documents which are my](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=211) [literature notes for these topics and](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=214) [these documents are editable and they](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=216) [look uh proper and again they're scaled](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=219) [down to this side so if I zoom out then](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=223) [you can see that those are actually](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=227) [teeny tiny especially compared to the](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=230) [one we wanted to do previously so just](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=233) [compare these two and compare the look](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=235) [and feel between the two so how do I do](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=238) [this there are a couple of new features](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=243) [so let's first of all pick up this video](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=246) [and let me show you one new feature so](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=249) [if I zoom into this video and let's say](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=252) [this is the scale where I want to watch](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=254) [the video now there's a new command](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=257) [pallet action I just type in scale](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=259) [selected embeddable elements to 100%](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=263) [relative to the current canvas Zoom so](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=267) [you can see the canvas Zoom currently is](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=270) [487 per. so when I select this action](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=274) [then my video is resized such that it](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=278) [looks good at this Zoom ratio I can do](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=282) [the same with my markdown document so](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=286) [here again I can just type in scale](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=289) [selected element and then I choose this](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=292) [then you can see that now the markdown](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=295) [ined was scaled down and you can edit it](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=298) [right here so how do you scale one way](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=302) [to scale is to use the common pallet](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=305) [action I've just shown you the other way](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=309) [to scale is here you can find the](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=312) [properties button if I press properties](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=316) [then here I can simply use this toggle](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=320) [to change the zoom ratio so I can zoom](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=324) [in and zoom out or scale scale in and](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=327) [scale out and if I want to find the](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=330) [relative size to be 100% so that's the](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=333) [same as the scaling function in the](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=336) [common pallet then I can press this](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=339) [button and it will automatically](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=341) [identify the the scale also you can](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=344) [simply add a start time to your video so](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=348) [if there's a particular point where you](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=350) [want to start the video then you can add](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=353) [that start time here and it will be](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=355) [saved to your your video I'm not not](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=358) [going to press okay I'm just going to](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=360) [leave it like this so that's one set of](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=363) [functions in terms of scaling the other](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=367) [set of functions is you might have](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=370) [noticed that this document here looks](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=372) [different compared to these two](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=375) [documents so these documents had a](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=377) [sketchy background and they had a](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=380) [different color and they had some border](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=382) [colors so I want to show you some of the](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=385) [settings now available](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=387) [first of all I have a setting and that](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=390) [has been there already for a time that](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=393) [the embeddable will follow the theme of](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=397) [your excolo drawing so if here I switch](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=400) [to dark mode then the embed bable will](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=403) [switch to dark mode as well so this is I](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=406) [think a nice feature if you like your](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=409) [theme and you like the light and dark](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=412) [versions of your theme then your drawing](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=414) [is always going to follow that you have](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=417) [other options as well that this always](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=419) [follows the obsidian theme but what I](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=420) [want to show you is the properties](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=423) [window right here because this document](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=426) [has significantly more properties now](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=430) [you don't see the properties because I](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=432) [have this turned on to use obsidian](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=434) [defaults that's why it looks like this](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=437) [but if I turn this off then you will see](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=440) [that I have lots of options so for](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=443) [example I can hide the file name as well](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=446) [as I can choose that the element follows](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=449) [either the background of the canvas so](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=452) [this brown or the background color of](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=455) [the element itself I can set the opacity](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=458) [of that background](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=461) [color maybe I'm going to set this to 80%](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=462) [so it is a strong background color but I](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=466) [can still see the sketch in the](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=470) [background and also I can select whether](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=471) [I want the element border color to match](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=475) [the stroke color of the element or I can](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=479) [choose a different color here by the way](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=482) [that's through here as well so if I](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=484) [don't want to match the element](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=487) [background color and I don't want to](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=488) [match the canvas background color then I](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=490) [can also choose a color that I want](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=492) [my embeddable to have so for example I'm](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=496) [just setting this embeddable to this](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=500) [pinkish color like this and I've hidden](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=503) [the file name and I'm going to](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=506) [add now this way a strong](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=509) [red border color and then I press okay](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=514) [then you can see well I'm not sure that](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=518) [this is an ideal combination of colors](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=520) [but you can see that for example I was](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=522) [able to configure this like this but](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=524) [also if I now choose to follow the](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=528) [element background color I remove this](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=530) [opacity to 80% or reduce it I follow the](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=533) [stroke color and press okay okay then it](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=537) [now is black because I have a](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=540) [transparent background but if I now](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=542) [change the background color here so if I](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=544) [choose a background color uh then that](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=547) [background color is going to be applied](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=550) [to my drawing and you can also see that](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=553) [if I change the field pattern then the](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=557) [field pattern changes here as well and](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=560) [also I can play with the element border](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=562) [Etc so this gives you lots of freedom](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=566) [in terms of how you want to manage the](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=569) [background color and the background look](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=573) [and feel of your markdown ined document](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=576) [you can even make this whole thing](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=579) [transparent the way to make it](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=582) [transparent is simply to reduce the](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=584) [opacity to](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=587) [0% and if I do this then now I can also](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=589) [hide the background color and with this](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=594) [I'm able to add a markdown document that](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=596) [is fully immersive in my excal](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=600) [drawing and then finally let me show you](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=604) [some of the CSS formatting options and](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=608) [in this case I'm going to demonstrate to](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=612) [you some of the canvas candy formatting](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=614) [options so let me just walk you through](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=618) [some of these options I'm just going to](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=621) [copy these from here and apply it to my](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=623) [document so you can see the effect of](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=626) [the different options so this is making](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=629) [the note transparent or I can pick up](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=633) [the next one and I can add this and this](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=636) [is going to add a label to the right TF](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=639) [hacker has done some real magic here](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=643) [with these uh CSS classes and in this](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=646) [case I can rotate the text in the Box by](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=650) [45° or in this](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=654) [case I can create create a dashed border](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=657) [around this now of course you can argue](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=661) [that you have the dash border anyway so](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=663) [here I can create a dashboard or align](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=666) [my drawing like that so you can see my](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=670) [exol dra dashes but if you want this](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=674) [more canvas looking Dash then you can](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=677) [choose this as well and finally you can](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=681) [even add shapes to these elements so in](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=683) [this case this is going to to make the](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=687) [note circle shape which is also a pretty](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=690) [cool feature so the bottom line is now](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=693) [exol draw supports the CSS classes in](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=698) [the front matter so if you're not using](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=702) [canvas scandy you can create your own](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=704) [CSS classes as well and you can format](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=707) [the notes in exol draw and then finally](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=710) [let's look at some of the settings so in](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=714) [settings you can set the default for the](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=718) [markdown ined so you can see here that](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=721) [this is under exol draw and you need to](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=723) [go to ined files into exol draw and](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=726) [you'll find the interactive markdown](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=729) [files settings here you see exactly the](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=731) [same settings that I've shown you with](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=734) [the](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=737) [properties but here you can set the](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=738) [default and then every time you insert a](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=740) [new markdown document that is going to](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=743) [follow this default and finally if you](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=746) [use exol draw together with obsidian](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=750) [canvas I implemented a new setting for](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=753) [you as well so in this case I have this](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=756) [drawing of this end and I'm going to](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=759) [drop this drawing onto the canvas like](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=762) [this and you can see that this is now](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=766) [dropped in without a border around the](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=769) [note and it's transparent so let me show](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=773) [you some of the settings that I've done](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=775) [so that I can insert this drawing like](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=778) [this onto the canvas first of all you](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=780) [need to go to exol draw settings and](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=783) [here under embedding exol draw into your](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=787) [notes and exporting you need to scroll](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=790) [down to obsidian canvas support and](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=793) [under obsidian canvas support you can](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=796) [turn on immersive embedding which will](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=799) [remove the border around the embedded](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=802) [object now that might not be enough so](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=806) [in this case in this drawing um I](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=809) [switched over to markdown View](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=812) [mode I added this front matter switch to](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=815) [export my drawing with a transparent](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=818) [background you can configure this in](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=822) [plug-in settings as well but I typically](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=824) [don't do this so I applied this front](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=826) [matter switch here if I remove](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=829) [this and I come back to the](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=832) [drawing and I save it then if if I come](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=835) [back here then you see that the drawing](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=839) [would be embedded like this it still](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=841) [doesn't have the border on canvas but](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=843) [it's not so immersive so if you want a](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=846) [fully immersive experience then you need](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=848) [to switch to markdown View mode and you](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=851) [need to add the excal export transparent](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=854) [through and with that you will be able](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=858) [to export a note that doesn't have the](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=861) [background color and it will look fully](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=865) [immersive on your canvas so that's all I](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=868) [wanted to share with you today in terms](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=871) [of these new features I am super excited](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=873) [about these new features I think they](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=877) [open up so many new opportunities for](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=879) [thinking visually and I'm Keen to know](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=882) [how you're using these features I invite](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=885) [you to join the visual thinking Discord](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=888) [server you can just simply click the](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=891) [link here on the splash screen and there](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=893) [in the Showcase section I would love to](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=896) [see examples of how you're using exol](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=899) [draw to think visually how you're using](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=903) [this new feature as well as on their](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=905) [feature requests and the other sections](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=908) [we can talk about enhancements and how](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=910) [you would want to take this plugin](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=912) [further thank you](https://youtu.be/502swdqvZ2A?t=915)
