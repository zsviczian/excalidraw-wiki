![Debunking Visual Myths: What science says and how to leverage it for better PKM](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA)

# Summary
In this video, Zsolt debunks several widespread myths about the processing of visual information, revealing that many statistics often cited about visuals lack rigorous research to support them. He discusses the notable contributions of Paul Martin Lester's work on the syntax of visual communication, emphasizing the important interplay between text and imagery. Zsolt concludes with practical takeaways for enhancing personal knowledge management (PKM) through effective use of visuals.

# Key Takeaways
- Many popular claims about visual processing speed and retention rates are not supported by credible research.
- Paul Martin Lester's syntactic theory of visual communication highlights the complementary roles of words and images in conveying meaning.
- Creating visuals that effectively represent complex ideas can enhance recall and aid in understanding abstract concepts.

# Content
Hey everyone, it's Zsolt here. Today, I want to cover three topics. First, I want to share with you what I found in my quick research or investigation about these outrageous statements about the power of visuals. Second, in this investigation, I came across a very interesting article, so I want to share with you what I found in that article. And third, I want to give you some practical takeaways—so, what can you do with all this information? [* ](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=0)

Let's start with these outrageous statements, and I'm sure you've come across these yourself. For example, this blog post says that we process images 60,000 times faster than text, it takes 13 milliseconds for the brain to process a visual, and 90% of the information we receive or process is visual. Many links lead to the 3M meeting Network, where, for example, one of the claims is that visual aids can improve learning by up to 400%. Or there’s this LinkedIn article that repeats all the previous claims and adds that people recall 80% of what they see, 10% of what they hear, and 20% of what they read. In this book "Visual Tools for Transforming Information into Knowledge" by David Hurley, there’s this claim referencing research that around 70% of the information from our environment is received through our eyes. And then there are these other articles that talk about the picture superiority effect. So here’s a quiz for you: which of these statements that you can see here are based on actual research and which are not? Which are just folk wisdom or downright incorrect? First, 90% of the information processed by the brain is visual—true or false? It takes only 13 milliseconds for the brain to process an image—true or false? The brain processes images 60,000 times faster than text—what do you think? And finally, people remember 80% of what they see compared to 10% of what they hear and 20% of what they read. So, these are the results that I came up with. [* ](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=31)

The first one, "90% of the information processed by the brain is visual," sounds reasonable, but I didn't find any rigorous research. Also, the number David Hurley references is 70%; this article and the LinkedIn article say 90%. I don’t think there’s really a number here, or at least most probably it’s neither of these two. Then, the second one about the 13 milliseconds—there is actually a research paper; you can find this, you can search for this. I’m going to include the link in the video description. It’s from 2013, and this actually describes the experiment and describes how the 13 milliseconds was measured. So this is actually real research and repeatable research. This statement about the 60,000 times faster processing of images over text does not seem to have any real research base. I read this article by Matic Pros, he refers to other articles as well, tracing back this claim to the early 1980s, but then the trace sort of disappears, and there is no actual research that can be found. And Hila El-Bore did a more in-depth research; again, you can find this article too. She looked into the claim of the 10-20-80% and found that there is no actual research evidence, or at least she was able to find all sorts of references to articles, and then the trace disappeared. It seems that the origin of this statement starts somewhere back in 1946 when Edgar Dale produced The Cone of Experience. Based on this, the National Training Laboratories produced this pyramid, or at least assumedly based on this because the two look similar, in 1960. But Hila was not able to identify if there's any research proving the numbers to be like this. And finally, there's this article by Trifler in 1967 that, again, looks similar in terms of percentages and elements, but there are differences. So, again no research backing or at least no reference to the actual research and experiment that was done. So, in essence, we can say that the 10-20-80% statement is more folk wisdom and probably incorrect. Definitely not based on some research. Of course, if anyone has the research paper, please share with us in the comments below; we would love to read it and see it. Until I do so, I'm going to believe that these statements are not true except for the 13 milliseconds. [* ](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=64)

But so what do you do with this information? It’s great to know it’s not true, but so what? Well, this is where we come to the article that I found. But before we jump into the article, I just wanted to mention that regardless of these percentages, based on experience, I can state that creating visuals, especially modeling by way of using diagrams, is a super good way of building and understanding. I’m thinking of process diagrams, concept maps, thinking maps, mind maps, etc. I have a whole bunch of videos on these topics, and if you’re interested, I recommend checking them out. Regardless of the percentages, I think this is very useful and hands-on information. [* ](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=375)

But let’s look at this article by Paul Martin Lester, "The Syntactic Theory of Visual Communication.” The article sounds super serious. I tried to create a visual summary of this that I hope you will like and will help you understand the concepts. Lester starts with this argument that they are taught to read stories, but we are never taught to read images. In fact, when you're a child, everything is a drawing, and then you learn about letter pictures, then word pictures, then sentence pictures. But throughout education, and very early on in education, there's this division—pictures on one side, text on the other side. Pictures play a subordinate role to words, and if you think about the classes you went to, there are many classes that deal with reading, writing, understanding stories, and understanding text. There’s only art class that deals with actually not only images but a broader area of the arts. So, I hope you like my Orellan image in the center there. In terms of pictures, they are good, but words are better. However, we are becoming a visually mediated society. Reading is losing to watching because viewing requires less mental processing. Guess what? You're now viewing a YouTube video! And at the same time, more than any other technological innovations, computers have created this explosion in the use of images and media. Back in 1955, this was already an issue and a concern to some people. This is actually not a book but a long article from that time: "Why Johnny Can't Read." The simplistic answer here is, because there are too many images and not enough words. But of course, there can be other explanations as well. Maybe there’s nothing worthwhile to read. Maybe reading is not required to make a living. Maybe Johnny’s parents are not reading, so he's not reading either. Or maybe Johnny is reading something else that is not recognized by the author of this writing. [* ](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=420)

Lester goes on to this assertion that there can be visual messages with their own rules of syntax that are being read, but this language may mean nothing to those who can only read words. Here, I did my attempt at translating this sentence into emojis—you can decide if I did a good job or not. I will also be very interested in your translation of this sentence into emojis in the comments below. So if you want to play with it, it’s super fun! Try to translate this into emoji and share it in the comments below. Regardless of how we think about the need for more reading or not, I think you cannot argue with the statement that words are easily forgotten but pictures stay in our minds. For example, if you’ve seen this picture from the 1989 Tiananmen Square uprising with this lone protester standing defiantly in front of a line of Chinese tanks, you will never forget this image. You might have forgotten the events and the details leading up to the event, but you’ve not forgotten this image. This sticks with you for your life. And of course, you remember this not only because it's a highly emotional image but also because you have thought about this image in your mind with words, and this is a point we’ll come back to a couple of times in this article—this translation of the image into words in your mind. [* ](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=638)

So from this introduction, Lester takes the discussion into a first discussion about the syntax of symbols where there’s a clear difference between pictures and text because pictures are presentational and not discursive. Discursive means that the complex information in your mind is translated into a narrative structure, into a train of thought that is sequential. While on the other hand, pictures are holistic; it’s like a shop window; you look at the whole thing in one go. There is no formal grammar to pictures, and as such, it is not a language. There are two issues with images: first, there is no recognized syntax, and second, there is no visual alphabet. I’m going to come back to these later on. So, that's why you see the arrows there. Without a language, they cannot be read. Susan Zarg argues that only that which narrates can make us understand. So in this sense, because pictures don’t narrate, the claim is that they cannot make us understand. [* ](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=749)

Now let's talk about these two claims that there’s no visual alphabet and no recognized syntax. First, about the alphabet. In the article, Lester references Fernanda St. Martin, and in her book, she defines the term of a color as the basic letter in a visual alphabet. This reminded me of a very interesting short video called "Fields, Forms, and Flows" by Dave Cray. If you search for this, you will find it on YouTube—a very interesting presentation. In this sense, the letters are the forms, which are the closed shapes, and the open lines, which are the flows. Then the other paper referenced by Lester is "Recognition by Components." This is a writing by Irving Biederman. Biederman talks about the concept of geons as visual shapes, and he argues that the brain uses these geons to store images symbolically in our brain. He was able to identify, I think, something like 30 to 60 geons that can describe everything. I don’t actually remember the number; you can look in the article. The bottom line is that the reason you’re able to recognize an object like a chair from different perspectives and different types of chairs is that it’s stored symbolically in your brains using something like geons as the letters of the visual alphabet. And that’s how the brain can process these. This is great, but it’s really not very practical, so there’s not much you can do with this information. [* ](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=834)

But then moving on to the other topic that there’s no recognized syntax. Noam Chomsky writes that language contains deep structures and surface structures. The surface structure is the arrangement of words in their proper order. This is super important for spoken or written language because it’s sequential and you need to know what comes after what. In the case of visuals, this is slightly different because you take in a picture in one blink instead of going through the sequential structure of text. But anyway, so that’s the surface structure. And then there are deep structures, which is the actual meaning of the word. It’s interesting that if you understand the surface structure, you can still understand the purpose of the word, even if you don’t understand the actual meaning of the word. Much is lost without grasping the true meaning of words. You can experience this if you read books from 100 or 200 years ago; you already need some education to understand what they meant by the words. Or if you're reading a foreign language, then again you can understand the sentence structure, but still, you might be missing some of the nuanced understanding. And this sort of links into my mind this Lex Fridman show—that's actually the recent Lex Fridman show and interview with Elon Musk about Neuralink. In this, Elon talks about the effective bit rate that increases with compression, and he mentions that actually, words are a form of compression. This reminded me that visuals provide a form of compression, and in some cases, visuals provide an even larger compression rate than words. But of course, you need to have the understanding behind those visuals. [* ](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=984)

Then there’s this other statement around the deep structures and the understanding that photography is the only language that is understood by all parts of the world. It's sort of a universal language. However, photographs quote rather than translate reality, and so that's an important difference here. In the end, you might argue that pictures are not a language in the verbal sense and pictures have no lexicon or syntax in a formal sense, but they do have form, structure, convention, and rules. This takes us to the discussion about the semiotic approach to visual communication. Semiotics is the study of the signs and symbols, their use and interpretation. In this sense, images are a collection of signs that are linked together in some way by the viewer. Yes, a picture is worth a thousand words, but only if you think or say or write those words down. If not, then that’s actually just a picture. [* ](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1084)

Semiotics is broken down into three separate topics or domains. There's pragmatics, which is the study of the origin, the common uses, and the communicative effects of signs. Then there’s semantics, which talks about the significance of signs in various cultures. For example, this sign means "OK" in one culture, "money" in another, and is the "middle finger" in another. So be careful of these signs! And then there’s syntactics, which is about combining signs to form messages. While pragmatics and semantics are important, they are not unique to visual communication. For this reason, we’re going to focus on syntactics, and the basic statement here is that a sign by itself means nothing; meaning depends on other signs. [* ](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1129)

There was this research that looked at how people read newspapers, and to me, it’s like the four wheels of a car. Later on, I’m going to have a reference to this car. Essentially, researchers found that people first look at the front page photograph, then they read the caption of the photograph, then they read the headline, and if they're still interested, they read the story. In this sense, one plus one—the picture and the text—equals three. The combination of these two symbolic systems, if they're used in a strategic way, is super powerful. So in this sense, it’s not correct to say that either words or pictures supplement the other; the right verb to use is "complement." Sometimes even the pride of authorship is mingled when you have a successful article. The role of text is to load the image, burdening it with culture, moral, and imagination, and of course, the role of the image is to raise awareness and communicate parts of thought that are impossible to articulate with words or would take many, many words to communicate. [* ](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1191)

This takes us to the three tenets of the syntactic theory of visual communication. Tenet one states that mediated words and pictures have equal importance in the communication process. In fact, words are signs of lines, curves, shapes, and colors rooted in images. Writing originated from cave drawings, and at one time, words were icons. It took us over a thousand generations to convert from iconic to symbolic signs. In this process, there were the Sumerian cuneiforms, then the Phoenician alphabet, and then came Gutenberg with his printing press, through which words gained dominance over images, leading to a decline in visual literacy as text became standardized. So look at the codex page versus a page from the Bible as printed by Gutenberg. [* ](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1312)

The second tenet is that mediated words and pictures are both symbolic representations, and symbols, in order to be thought and remembered, must be verbalized. So, if I look at the sign there, I need to think "North" to understand what’s there. The second statement here is that concrete nouns are far more memorable and aid in recall better than abstract ones. My argument is that illustrations can help turn the abstract into something concrete. This is why it’s super hard to come up with a good illustration, because you’re trying to convert an abstract idea into something concrete. So essentially words are the images of things, and giving names to objects enhances the memory of those objects. Sometimes words, like in the case of "loop," actually look like the word. I liked this because this is so loopy! In these cases, the words are the images of things. [* ](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1392)

Finally, the third tenet states that images are remembered by thinking about them in words. Images are a collection of signs and as such become language when read in the mind. Lester concludes with this beautiful vision for the future that when words and images hold equal importance across all forms of communication, different cultures will find it easier to understand one another. So that's all good; but so what, you might ask? Here are my six takeaways from this discussion. [* ](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1424)

First of all, text and visuals both play a mutually reinforcing role in note-taking, in PKM, in communications—all of these things, complementing and reinforcing each other's impact. This means that you should actually take time to do deliberate design. Aim for a tight alignment between your visuals, your captions, titles, and text to achieve maximum impact and coherence in your material. So don’t just put a pretty picture there; think about what you want to put there. I have this video; I’m going to link it in the description below about the seven steps to create concept visuals—there is a process you can use to create visuals that communicate the idea and are not just a picture to make the page more colorful. [* ](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1514)

The third idea I want you to take away is this idea of compression of ideas and how images act as a powerful form of information compression, conveying complex concepts in the blink of an eye. One way I use images in my book on page summaries is once I have these individual images—these atomic illustrations of ideas—I can start to shuffle them around and create a new story using those images, and work with those ideas at a higher level, at the meta level, because I can look at the whole paragraph of the book summarized in a single visual. Of course, I can then look behind the scenes to read the entire paragraph or entire chapter for myself, but essentially these visuals become a compression of ideas. [* ](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1554)

Then, fourth, narration is essential. Adding verbal summaries, titles, and captions to illustrations strengthens their value as aids in recall. The way I do this is in Excalidraw—you can flip the image over—but in PowerPoint, you can add slide notes and so on. I actually like to write down my summary sentence or a few summary sentences about the visual, and that way, the visual and my summarization become one unit of information. And this verbalization is indeed essential in terms of getting the best use of images. [* ](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1613)

Then fifth is this idea about the abstract to concrete. The idea that we remember the concrete much better than the abstract and my argument that creating illustrations is the process of transforming the abstract into the concrete. It’s extremely hard, but it's hard for a reason because it’s very difficult to make the abstract concrete. [* ](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1632)

Finally, the idea is about sharpening your tools, because traditional education emphasizes writing. My advocacy is that investing your time in learning illustration can provide much better value for money; you get better bank for your buck. Instead of going to another writing course, I recommend you check out my visual thinking workshop. The cohort starts at the end of August, and there are still places available, so if you're interested, check the link in the description and join cohort 10. [* ](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1674)

So that’s all I wanted to share with you today. We looked at these outrageous statements and concluded that most of them are not based on actual research. We spent more time looking at this paper by Paul Martin Lester, and then hopefully these six takeaways you find them practical and will help you take your communication, your PKM, and your note-taking to the next level. Thank you! [* ](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1690)

and there is no actual](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=240) [research that can be found and hilia the](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=242) [boore did a more in-depth research again](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=246) [you can find this article as](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=250) [well into the claim of the 10 20 80% and](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=253) [found that there is no actual research](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=257) [evidence or at](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=261) [least hilia was able to find all sorts](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=262) [of references to articles and then](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=265) [the trace](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=270) [disappeared it seems that the origin of](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=271) [this statement starts somewhere back in](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=276) [1946 when Edgard Dale produced The Cone](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=279) [of](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=283) [experience based on this the National](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=284) [Training Laboratories produced this](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=287) [pyramid or at least assumedly based on](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=291) [this because the two look similar in](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=294) [1960 but hilia was is not able to](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=297) [identify if there's any](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=301) [research proving the numbers uh to be](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=304) [like this and finally there's this](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=307) [article by trifler in](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=311) [1967 that again looks similar in terms](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=313) [of it there are percentages and there](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=317) [are things like read here see the](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=319) [numbers are](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=322) [different but so again no research](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=323) [backing or at least no reference to the](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=326) [actual res research and experiment that](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=329) [was done so in essence we can say that](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=331) [the 10 20](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=336) [80% statement is more folk wisdom and](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=337) [probably incorrect definitely not based](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=342) [on some research of course if on any

for](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=360) [the 13](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=364) [milliseconds but so what do you do with](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=366) [this information it's great to know it's](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=368) [not true but so what well so this is](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=370) [where we come to the article that I](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=375) [found but before we jump into the](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=378) [article I just wanted to mention that](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=380) [regardless of these percentages based

you](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=438) [understand the](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=441) [concepts Lester starts with this](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=443) [argument that they are thought to

[everything is a drawing and then your](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=454) [thought or you learn about letter](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=457) [pictures then word pictures then](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=461) [sentence pictures but throughout the](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=463) [education and very early on Ed in the](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=467)

an](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=545) [issue and a concern to some people that](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=549) [this this is a actually not a book but a](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=553) [long article from that time why Johnny](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=555) [can't](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=559) [read and the simplistic answer here is](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=560) [because there are too many images and](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=563) [not enough words but of course there can](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=566) [be other explanations as well maybe](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=568) [there's nothing worthwhile to read maybe](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=570) [reading is not required to make a living](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=574)

is](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=582) [not recognized by the author of this](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=585) [writing and Lester goes on to this](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=591) [assertation that there can be visual](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=594) [messages with their own rules of syntax](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=597) [that are being read but this language](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=600) [May mean nothing to those who can only](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=604) [read words and here I did my attempt of](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=607) [translating this sentence into](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=610) [emojis you can decide if I did a good](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=613) [job or not and I will be also

not](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=677) [only because it's a highly emotional](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=680) [image but also because you have thought](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=682) [about this image in your mind with ver](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=686) [and this is a point we'll come back to a](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=689) [couple of times in this article this](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=691) [translation of the image into words in](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=694) [your mind so from this introduction](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=697) [Lester takes the discussion into first a](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=701) [discussion about the syntax of](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=705) [symbols where there's a clear difference](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=709) [between pictures and text because](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=712) [pictures are presentational and not](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=715) [discursive](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=718) [discursive means](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=719) [that the complex information in your](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=721) [mind is translated into a narrative](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=724) [structure into a train of thought that](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=727) [is sequential while on the other hand](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=730) [pictures are holistic it's like a shop](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=734) [window you you look at the whole thing](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=737) [in one go there is no formal crammer to](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=739) [pictures and as such there is it is not](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=743) [a language there are two issues with](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=747) [images first there is no recognized](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=751) [syntax and second there is no visual](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=753) [alphabet and I'm going to come back to](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=757) [these later on so that's why you see the](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=758) [arrows there and without a language they](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=761) [cannot be read and Susan zag argues that](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=764) [only that which narrates can make us](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=768) [understand so in this sense because](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=772) [pictures don't narrate the claim is it](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=775) [can not make us understand so now let's](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=778) [talk about these two claims that there's](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=782) [no visual alphabet and no recognized](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=784) [syntax first about the](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=788) [alphabet in the article Lester](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=790) [references Fernanda St Martin and in her](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=794) [book she defines the term of a color as](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=798) [the basic letter in a visual alphabet](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=803) [this reminded me so this is not from the](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=807) [book but something I found very](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=809) [interesting about Fields forms and flows](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=811) [by Dave cray if you search for this you](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=814) [will find this on YouTube a very](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=816) [interesting short](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=818) [video and in this sense the letters are](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=821) [the forms which are the closed shapes](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=824) [and the open lines which are the](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=826) [flows and then the other paper reference](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=830) [by Lester is recognition by components](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=835) [this is](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=838) [a writing by iring](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=839) [biderman biderman talks

visual alphabet and that's how the](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=890) [brain can process these and this is](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=892) [great but this is really not very](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=896) [practical so there is not much you can](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=899) [do with this](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=901) [information but then moving on to the](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=903) [other topic that there is no recognized](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=906) [syntax no Chomsky writes that

after](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=933) [what in case of visuals this is slightly](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=935) [different because you take in a picture](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=938) [in](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=941) [one blink instead of going through the](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=942) [sequential structure of a text but](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=946) [anyway so that's the surface structure](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=949) [and then there are deep structures which](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=952) [is the actual meaning of the word and](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=955) [it's interesting that if you understand](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=959) [the surface structure you can still](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=961) [understand the purpose of the word even](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=963) [if you don't understand the actual](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=966) [meaning of the word and much is lost](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=968) [without grasping the true meaning of](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=971) [words you can experience this if you](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=973) [read books from 100 200 years ago you](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=976) [already need some education to](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=980) [understand what they meant by the

[the sentence structure but still you](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=989) [might be missing some of the nuanced](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=991) [understanding and this sort of Linked In](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=995) [My Mind this Lex fredman show that's](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=999) [actually the recent Lex Freedman show](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1002) [and

increases](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1010) [with compression and he mentions that](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1014) [actually wordss are a form of](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1016) [compression and this reminded me that](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1019) [actually visuals provide a form of](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1021) [compression and in some cases visuals](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1025) [provide an even](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1028) [larger compression rate than vers but of](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1029) [course you need to have the](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1033) [understanding behind those](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1035) [visuals and then there's this other](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1039) [statement around the Deep structures and](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1042) [the understanding that](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1045) [photography is the only language that is](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1049) [understood by all parts of the world](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1053) [it's sort of a universal language](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1055) [however](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1058) [photographs quote rather than translate](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1059) [reality and so that's an important](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1063) [difference here and in the end you might](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1066) [argue that pictures are not a language](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1070) [in the verbal sense and pictures have no](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1072) [lexicon or syntax in a formal Aran sense](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1075) [but they do have form structure](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1080) [convention and](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1082) [rules and this takes us to this](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1084) [discussion about the semiotic approach](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1087) [to visual communication semiotics is the](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1090) [study of the signs and symbols and their](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1093) [use and](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1096) [interpretation in this sense images are](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1100) [a collection of signs that are linked](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1102) [together in some way by the viewer](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1106) [and yes a picture is worth a thousand](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1109) [wordss but only if you think or say or](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1113) [write those words down if not then](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1117) [that's actually just a picture so](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1121) [semiotics is broken down into three](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1125) [separate topics or domains there's](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1129) [pragmatics which is the study of the](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1131) [origin and the common uses and](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1134) [communicative effects of science](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1136) [then there's semantics which talks about](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1139) [the significance of signs in various](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1142) [cultures so for example this sign means](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1145) [okay in one culture money in another and](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1148) [is the middle finger in another so be](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1151) [careful of it signs and then there's](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1154) [syntactics which is about combining](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1157) [signs to form](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1159) [messages and while pragmatics and](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1162) [semantics are important they are not](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1165) [unique unque to visual communication for](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1168) [this reason we're going to focus on](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1171) [syntactics and the basic statement here](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1175) [is a Sign by itself means nothing](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1177) [meaning depends on other](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1180) [signs so there was this research that](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1183) [looked at how people read newspaper and](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1186) [to me it's like the four wheels of a car](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1190) [and later on I'm going to have a](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1192) [reference to this](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1194) [car essentially researchers found that](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1196) [people first look at the front page](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1199) [photograph then they read the caption of](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1202) [the photograph then they read the](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1205) [headline and if they're still interested](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1207) [they read the story and in this sense 1](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1210) [plus one the picture and the text equals](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1214) [three the combination of these two](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1217) [symbolic systems if they're used in a](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1220) [strategic way is super](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1223) [powerful so in this sense it's not](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1227) [correct to say that either words or](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1230) [pictures supplements the other the right](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1233) [verb to use is](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1236) [compliments and sometimes even the pride](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1238) [of authorship are mingled when you have](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1240) [a successful art](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1243) [article the role of text is to load the](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1245) [image burdening it with culture moral](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1249) [and Imagination and of course the role](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1252) [of the image is to raise awareness and](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1254) [also communicate parts of the thought](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1259) [that are impossible to communicate via](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1262) [words or would take many many words to](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1265) [communicate and this takes us to the](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1269) [three tenets of the syntactic theory of](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1271) [visual](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1274) [communication 10et one says that](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1275) [mediated words and pictures have equal](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1278) [importance in the communication process](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1281) [in fact wordss are signs of lines curves](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1284) [shapes and colors rooted in](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1287) [images are writing originated from cave](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1292) [drawings and at one time words were](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1296) [icons and it took us over a thousand](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1300) [generations to convert from an iconic to](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1303) [symbolic signs in this process there](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1308) [were the Sumerian Kun forms and then the](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1312) [Phoenician alphabet and then came](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1316) [Gutenberg with his printing press](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1319) [through which wordss gained dominance](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1322) [over images leading to a decline in](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1325) [visual liter literacy as text became](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1329) [standardized so look at the codex page](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1332) [versus a page from the Bible as printed](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1334) [by](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1337) [Gutenberg the second tenet is that](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1339) [mediated wordss and pictures are both](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1342) [symbolic representations](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1346) [and symbols in order to be thought and](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1348) [remembered must be verbalized so if I](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1352) [look at the sign there I need to think](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1356) [North to understand what's](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1359) [there the second statement here is that](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1362) [concrete nouns are far more memorable](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1365) [and Aid to recall better than abstract](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1369) [ones my argument is illustrations can](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1372) [help turn abstract into something](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1376) [concrete this is why it's super hard to](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1378) [come up with a good illustration because](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1381) [you're trying to convert an abstract](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1383) [idea into something](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1386) [concrete so essentially verds are the](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1389) [images of things and giving names to](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1392) [objects enhances the memory of those](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1395) [objects and sometimes words like in case](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1398) [of loop actually look like the ver I](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1401) [liked this because this is so loopy so](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1404) [in these the words are images of](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1408) [things finally the third tenet states](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1410) [that images are remembered by thinking](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1414) [about them in words images are a](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1416) [collection of signs and as such become](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1420) [language when read in the](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1422) [mind Lester concludes with this](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1424) [beautiful vision for the future that](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1428) [when words and images hold equal](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1430) [importance across all forms of](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1433) [communications different cultures will](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1435) [find it easier to understand one](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1438) [another so that's all good but so what](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1442) [you might ask so here are my six](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1446) [takeaways from all of this](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1448) [discussion first of all text and](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1451) [visuals both play a mutually reinforcing](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1455) [role in note taking in PKM in](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1459) [Communications in in all of these things](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1463) [complimenting and reinforcing each](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1467) [other's impact which means that you](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1469) [should actually take time to do](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1472) [deliberate design aim for a tight](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1476) [alignment between your visuals your](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1479) [captions titles and text to achieve](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1481) [Maximum Impact and coherence in your](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1484) [material so don't just put a pretty](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1486) [picture there think about what you want](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1489) [to put there I have this video I'm going](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1491) [to link it in the description below](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1494) [about the seven steps to create concept](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1498) [visuals there is a process that you can](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1501) [use to create visuals that](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1503) [are that communicate the idea and they](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1507) [are not just a picture to make the page](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1511) [more](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1514) [colorful then the third idea I'm taking](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1515) [away and I recommend you to take away is](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1518) [this idea of compression of ideas and](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1521) [how images act as a powerful form of](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1524) [information compression conveying](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1527) [complex Concepts in the blink of an eye](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1530) [I the one way I use images and my book](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1533) [on a page summaries is once I have these](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1536) [individual images these Atomic](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1539) [illustrations of ideas I can start to](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1542) [shuffle them around and create a new](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1544) [story using those images and work with](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1546) [those ideas at a at a higher level at](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1550) [The Meta level because I can look at the](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1554) [whole paragraph of the book summarized](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1556) [in a single Visual and of course I can](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1558) [then look behind the scenes to read the](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1561) [entire paragraph or entire chapter for](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1563) [myself but essentially these visuals](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1566) [become a compression of](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1569) [ideas then fourth narration is essential](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1572) [so adding verbal summaries titles](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1576) [captions to illustrations strengthens](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1579) [their uh value as AIDS in](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1582) [recall the way I do this is in exol draw](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1585) [you can flip the image over but in](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1589) [PowerPoint you can add slide notes and](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1591) [so on I actually like to write down my](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1594) [summary sentence or a few summary](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1599) [sentences about the visual and that way](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1601) [the visual and my summarization become](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1605) [one unit of](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1609) [information and this](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1611) [verbalization is indeed essential in](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1613) [terms of getting the best use of](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1616) [images then fifth is this idea about](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1620) [abstract to concrete the idea that we](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1623) [remember the concrete much better than](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1627) [the abstract and my argument that](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1629) [visuals creating](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1632) [illustrations is the process of](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1634) [transforming the abstract into concrete](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1637) [it's extremely hard but it's hard for a](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1641) [reason because it's very hard to make](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1644) [the abstract concr](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1646) [and finally the idea is about sharpening](https://youtu.be/_3-OmhLeZUA?t=1649)
