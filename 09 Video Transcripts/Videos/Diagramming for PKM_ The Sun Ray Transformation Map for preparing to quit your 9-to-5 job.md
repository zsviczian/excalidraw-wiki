Hey, welcome back; Jol here. Remember, in our last session, we explored the potential impacts of quitting our job using the Futures Wheel. We discovered that it won't be a walk in the park. Today, we're developing a roadmap of actions using the Sun Ray Transformation Map, setting us up for success for when we actually do quit our job, not just fantasize about it. Along the way, I'll also show you how I use Excalidraw scripts and advanced features to assist me with charting, plus we will briefly explore how you can access the actions you create on the Excalidraw canvas through the data view plugin in other notes. [* ](https://youtu.be/Y-cZrWlRAWc?t=0)

Throughout this video, I'll be referencing thinkers like Steven CI, James Clear, James Alure, Tim Ferris, and Scott Galloway. Ki's principle of beginning with the end in mind is crucial here; it reminds us to have a clear vision of our future selves. The future me being the balance between financial success and pursuing our dreams; it's about knowing what you want to achieve to prevent ending up worse off than before. Let's begin by drawing our template. I'll turn on the grid via the context menu and then create a rectangle. First, I'll make three other copies of this rectangle using Alt or Option drag. I'll delete the other rectangles once our template is ready; they only serve as guidelines for our drawing. [* ](https://youtu.be/Y-cZrWlRAWc?t=15)

Now, I want to create four elliptical lines to split our space into five sections: immediate, short-term, medium-term, long-term, and the future me. I'll start with the largest ellipse, dragging it from its top left corner. Once I'm done with it, I'll duplicate it with Alt or Option drag and place it right on top of the previous ellipse. Then I resize the second ellipse, holding down Shift to maintain the aspect ratio along with Alt or Option to scale from the center. I'll repeat the same steps for the remaining two ellipses. But wait, I only need a section of these ellipses, not the entire thing. So, how do I cut these ellipses into pieces? The Split Ellipse script comes to the rescue. You can install scripts by clicking the Obsidian menu, then clicking this button to open the script store and searching for "Split Ellipse." For Split Ellipse to work, I need to create a line that will cut the ellipse. I'll use the line tool to draw an L shape following the side of the rectangle. Then I select the ellipse and the line, and run the script by pressing Control or Command P to open the command palette and select Split Ellipse from the list, and boom, we've split our first ellipse. I can just delete the outer three quarters and leave only the part we need. I'll do the same for the other three ellipses as well. So our time frames are immediate, short-term, medium-term, and long-term. I'll place the future me in the top right; that's our sun, our North Star. Then we need three sunrays to split our map into four sections: these are the work streams: developing resilience, entrepreneurship, financial stability, and building relationships. [* ](https://youtu.be/Y-cZrWlRAWc?t=60)

Now let's dive into the heart of our transformation: the work streams and time horizons that will take us from dreaming to doing, ensuring we're ready when our opportunities arrive. First things first, let's embed our Futures Wheel next to the Transformation Map so we can easily reference it when required. You can embed the image by simply selecting Insert Any File from the context menu. The additional benefit of inserting this image is that now the two files are linked. I have my link to the Futures Wheel here under outgoing links and if I open the Futures Wheel, I can see my roadmap under backlinks. Looking at our Futures Wheel, we can group our findings into three broad categories: financial, entrepreneurial, and relationship challenges. Let's look at the area where we have the most of the red bubbles first—remember, we colored these red because they were risks that could have an adverse effect. As Scott Gallow notes, wealth is the balance between passive income and burn rate; adjusting both is crucial for financial freedom. Gallow asserts that adjusting our burn rate is as important as increasing our income. [* ](https://youtu.be/Y-cZrWlRAWc?t=251)

We'll start by reviewing monthly expenses and identifying non-essential costs to cut. Smart budgeting is the cornerstone of lasting wealth. Then we'll define our pre-quit financial strategy and set a clear monthly savings goal in line with our current income. In the short term, we should start investing in low-cost index funds, ideally automating the process for consistency. Index funds are a better choice than picking a single stock, as they decrease the risk of bad luck. Over any historical 10-year period, your investment in the S&P 500 would have outpaced inflation. While this is not a guarantee for the future, it is definitely something to keep in mind. Galloway recommends against day trading, an option I wholeheartedly share. When I began investing in stocks, I was tempted by hindsight bias and spent many months day trading. While in the end, I came out net positive, the stress was high, and the returns did not beat the market. But don't end up in the other extreme—never looking at your investments. It is wise to review and adjust investments based on performance and goals at least annually. If you're serious about quitting, establish an emergency fund of at least 6 to 12 months; more is better. It gives you time to explore and start new ventures after you've quit. [* ](https://youtu.be/Y-cZrWlRAWc?t=364)

Before moving on to other areas, I want to show you a neat feature. First, notice how I made all my actions as markdown to-do items. What do you think—why did I do that? Let's open another note and add a data view query to grab all the task items from our roadmap. For our demonstration purposes, I will keep this very simple. This query will list all open actions from files that are tagged with "roadmap." See how if I mark an item completed here, it will be marked as complete on our roadmap as well. I typically use this feature to capture actions on the viewboard in meetings, then track them in my GTD process. But there are two more small practical details I need to show you; otherwise, this might not work for you. [* ](https://youtu.be/Y-cZrWlRAWc?t=467)

First, if I flip the page by switching over to markdown view mode, you will see I have already tagged this document with the roadmap tag. Data view offers different ways to reference files for our demonstration. Now, this seemed as the easiest approach; I won't go into details here but wanted to highlight to you what I did. Second, notice how the markdown comment tag is above the drawing section and not above text elements. This is the default setting, but if you're an advanced user like Nicole and placed the comment section above text elements to hide the Excalidraw markup from your published notes, then data view may not pick up the tasks. Notice how moving the comment block affects the results of the data view query. We won't explore this further now; just something to keep in mind. Now, back to our roadmap. Relationships are vital not only for social connections but also for increasing luck. James Alure argues that we are the average of the five people we spend the most time with. Building relationships with successful people and those we admire is key. Creating a LinkedIn profile seems simple, but it opens doors to opportunities. Joining local and online communities that align with our goals and starting to contribute will also inspire and raise our ambitions. Make it routine to regularly attend industry events to meet peers and leaders, but you don't need to wait for others to organize events—you can organize your own event as well. [* ](https://youtu.be/Y-cZrWlRAWc?t=517)

I learned about reactive, proactive, and generative approaches over 20 years ago. The reactive person will discover opportunities at the last minute, resulting in tardiness and unpreparedness. When you are proactive, this means that you're actively monitoring forums, signing up on time, and arriving prepared. The generative approach involves planning and hosting a networking event or online meetup yourself. A great way to strengthen relationships is by creating value for others—offer help with projects or introductions. If people value your help, they'll want to meet you and speak highly of you, increasing your surface area for luck. Make it a point to maintain these practices in the long term—organize or speak at industry events to maintain a high profile. Scott Galloway notes that success in business is rare; be wary of most of the advice you can find, as they are often colored by survivorship bias. To leave your job and start your own, you must be ready for rejection and failure—get used to uncomfortable situations and learn to bounce back quickly. [* ](https://youtu.be/Y-cZrWlRAWc?t=667)

A method I recall, possibly from Tim Ferris's "4-Hour Workweek," is to challenge yourself to initiate conversations with strangers. This practice will strengthen your resilience to awkward situations and rejections. Reflect on each rejection to learn without self-judgment. You can also build resilience by attending improvisation classes and reaching out with business ideas to potential partners regularly. Tracking proposals, successes, and rejections can help document progress and identify improvements. Continue refining your approach by reviewing rejection experiences and writing a blog about building resilience. Turning passion projects into profitable businesses is challenging. Galloway suggests considering less glamorous but more lucrative jobs for higher success rates as fallback options; think about the market for plumbers, for example. You want to leave your job to pursue your dreams, hobbies, and interests. Make a list of passions, hobbies, and business ideas. James Clear advocates the daily habit of creating and sharing something valuable; these contributions will compound and increase your chances of significant breakthroughs over time. Pursue multiple passions to generate additional income, but even if they don't generate substantial income, in my experience, the skills you gain doing what you love will help you deliver results in other areas of your life and work. For example, I'm increasingly making use of the presentation and storytelling skills I develop on YouTube at work. [* ](https://youtu.be/Y-cZrWlRAWc?t=812)

Be realistic about making a living. Set an experimentation time box and rink fence risky pursuits. Gallow's advice is to experiment for a while, but then be ready to take the best option when your time box expires rather than risk depleting your emergency fund without achieving a sustainable income. Finally, you want to build resilience against life's uncertainties. James Alure recommends developing seven different income streams. So this is how you can chart a course to the new me using our Futures Wheels insights. Remember, this is just an example—conduct thorough research and create your own transformation map. Also, understand that this map is a demonstration of the Sun Ray Transformation Map, a visual thinking tool, not financial or job and life advice. While the ideas I presented are ones I apply and believe in, they are for illustrative purposes here. As German military strategist Helmuth von Moltke the Elder put it, no plan survives contact with the enemy. Revisit your plan regularly and don't hesitate to change it if you're moved to create your own roadmap to resilience and use visual tools to aid your thought process.
